  <h2 class='c006'>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>
<hr class='c010' />
<p class='c011'>In presenting the following pages to the reader, the
publisher has no ambition to aspire to the character of
an author, and what is perhaps more rare, he has no private
interest to serve; he does not seek to gratify the
fastidious part of the community, who would have more
respect for the dress, or appearance, than for the subject
matter. He is perfectly aware that the Journal is not
without some imperfections; but it must be kept in mind
that it was not written for the public, with an eye to
publication, or to make a book—but simply as a memorandum
of the events of each day. Yet when we take
into consideration all the circumstances, it is little less
than a miracle; consider the author: a youth of scarcely
nineteen summers—then the places where the records
were made—the cable tier of a man-of-war, the gloomy
recesses of a prison, or on board the battle ship, where
three or four hundred men were crowded together for
the purposes of strife and blood; then take into consideration
the prohibition of all materials for writing in
prison, the vigilance of the guards, and the frequent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>search made among the prisoners, and it becomes a
matter of surprise, not that it has some imperfections,
but that it exists at all, and especially that it was never
interrupted. For the long imprisonment of more than
<em>two years</em>, it seems to have been providentially preserved,
for the purposes of bringing to light the hidden things
of darkness, that those who should come after may be
admonished and instructed.</p>

<p class='c000'>The reader will find the Journal free from all appearance
of <em>design</em> or effort; it is perfectly natural; what is
seen or heard is recorded with hardly a note or comment,
from first to last; through their medium we are
conducted through the hold of the prison-ship, and witness
the privations and sufferings of the hapless victims;
the prison hospital is thrown open to our inspection,
not as transient visitors, but as witnesses of the
daily occurrences; here we see justice and mercy
meeting together; the walls, the bars, the guards, tell
that here stern justice holds its victims, while the attendant
physician, and gentle patience of the nurse,
speak of Mercy’s visits, and pity. Then the prison
doors grate on their hinges, and we enter; the vacant
stare of the sons of Sorrow meet us, while their meager
forms, sallow countenances and ragged habiliments,
speak of their privations and misery; we seem to listen
to their tale of woe, and hear them tell of happy
homes and kind friends in their native land; we can
almost taste their scanty and uninviting portions,
and our sympathies become deeply interested, until
we share in all their anxieties to obtain deliverance; we
are sometimes almost suffocated while following the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>diggers in their excavations, to force a subterranean
passage to the light of day and air of freedom; anon
we are bounding over the fields as the minions of tyranny
pursue us, until, weary and exhausted, we feel their
ruthless hands upon us to drag us back to our gloomy
habitations; then we feel the cold chill run over us, as
we look forward to forty days and nights in darkness
and solitude in the “Black hole,” on half the usual allowance
of ordinary prisoners; we become acquainted
with the “Two Fathers,” the messengers of Love and
Pity—and while the donations continue we seem to
enjoy a respite; hope and fear alternately rise and sink,
until the donation closes, and transient joy gives way
to deeper gloom, until some of the less determined seek
relief on board the enemy’s ships of war, where they
will be compelled to meet their friends and countrymen
in the bloody strife—a destiny more horrible to the
mind capable of reflection, than the protracted miseries
of the prison cell.</p>

<p class='c000'>At length the star of hope rises, and the news of a
cartel is received; now it arrives, and we are straining
our eyes through the dim light of the grated window
to look on the ship, as she lays in the creek. Post
after post is anxiously looked for until the agent musters
his wretched charge and reads as follows: “His Majesty
has been graciously pleased to pardon one hundred
of you, in order to an exchange.” The names of the
hundred are read, while tears of joy point out the happy
ones. Once more the prison doors give way—and
with what rapture they hail the breath of freedom!</p>

<p class='c000'>From the time that Mr. Herbert entered the service
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>of the United States under the command of Commodore
Jones, the entries in his journal are less frequent
and less full; still, if it had not been for the unfortunate
loss of several pages of the Journal, it would have
been sufficiently full, to have conducted the reader
through their several cruizes, to their arrival home; as
it is, we have endeavored to fill up the vacuum by extracts
from the official reports of Commodore <em>Paul Jones</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is believed that the reader will receive profit and
pleasure from the numerous and various incidents here
related, and from the information imparted on a variety
of subjects, especially as it shows the views and feelings
of the people of England on the subject of the
war then raging between this and the mother country;
and that the strong sympathy manifested towards the
prisoners, in the collection of upwards of <em>thirty thousand
dollars</em> for their relief, together with all the private
donations, not included in the above, will be an everlasting
monument to the benevolence of British Christians,
and may tend to soften our prejudices and lead to
stronger sympathies for each other, and greater efforts
to promote each other’s welfare, and mutual feelings
of peace and good will.</p>

<p class='c000'>A list of the prisoners, with the places to which they
belonged, and vessels in which they were taken, also a
notice of such as had made their escape, had died, or
entered the service of Great Britain, will no doubt be
acceptable to such as had friends in the service of their
country, and of whom, perhaps, they have never since
heard. The list was taken, as will be seen, a short
time before Mr. Herbert left prison.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>The indulgence of the critic is hoped for, under the
assurance that the task of preparing the Journal for the
press has been arduous, as much of it was originally
written in figures to secure secrecy, and had to be
spelled out by reference to the key; that the task was
performed amidst a press of more important duties, and
with a fixed purpose of devoting all the avails of the
sales of the work to the widow of the author, after paying
the expense of publication.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>SKETCH OF THE AUTHOR.</h2>
</div>
<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c011'>It is perfectly natural to expect, in presenting any
work to the public, and more especially of the nature
of a journal, that the reader will desire to know something
of the character of its author, in order to determine
what degree of confidence the writer is entitled to,—whether
the statements made are to be depended
upon or not. In compliance with this reasonable demand,
we will endeavor to impart such information as
we possess, believing that it will be perfectly satisfactory.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Charles Herbert</span> was the son of John Herbert, of
Newburyport, Mass. His mother’s name was Jane,
daughter of Colonel Pierce of that town. Mr. Charles
Herbert was born November 17th, in the year of our
Lord 1757, but, being deprived of his mother by death,
at the early age of two months, he was committed to
the care of a maiden aunt—Miss Lydia Pierce, sister
of his mother. The influence of early training, as developed
in the life of Mr. Herbert, is very creditable to
his early tutoress. Moral and religious principle must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>have taken a deep root in his young heart, to have preserved
that heart from the gross and corrupting influence
of the society into which he was afterwards
thrown. The fruit appears in lovely contrast with the
abandoned profligacy of many of his companions, and
no doubt afforded him abundant consolation in the hours
of suffering and solitude. His character gave to him a
sort of pre-eminence among his fellows, and an influence
with his captors and keepers, which his companions
did not share. He was a true patriot; neither
frowns nor flatteries could move him to abandon his
country’s interest. If good tidings reach him, his
heart exults with joy; if dark clouds hang over the
prospects of the patriot band, he is sorrowful, and will
not be comforted; he can endure hunger, confinement,
or reproach—any thing but the extinguishing of his
country’s hope. Others, for the sake of personal liberty,
can join the standard of the enemy: but not so
with him; he cannot betray the cause of his country,
or go to battle against <em>his brother</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>From the Journal the reader will learn that Mr. Herbert
entered on board the Dolton, Nov. 15, 1776, being
less than nineteen years of age, and returned to Newburyport
Aug. 23, 1780, having been absent nearly four
years, two of which he spent as a prisoner, in a foreign
land. The sufferings of this period were of the most
distressing kind—hunger, cold, sickness, and privation.
After his release, by an exchange of prisoners, brought
about by the efforts of Dr. Franklin, then Minister to
France, Mr. Herbert joined the Alliance frigate, commanded
by Captain Landais, forming part of the squadron
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>of Commodore J. Paul Jones. He was one of those
sent to Bergen, in Norway, then a part of the kingdom
of Denmark, with prizes—which prizes were seized by
the Danish government and delivered to the English
Consul, which forms the basis of the “Denmark
Claims,” so called; and which amounted then, according
to Dr. Franklin, to at least fifty thousand pounds
sterling. The crews of these vessels, on their return
from Denmark, were kindly entertained by Dr. Franklin,
at his house; and on leaving, he paid their expenses
and gave each person a crown. Mr. Herbert preserved
his, as a sacred treasure, as long as he lived, but it has
since his death been lost. It is to be hoped that those
claims against Denmark will be brought to a speedy
settlement, and the few survivors of the eventful scenes
of Paul Jones’ career be rewarded for their sufferings.
Mr. Herbert possessed a remarkably active mind,
prompt and ready on all occasions; he met every emergency
with the utmost self-possession. This is seen in
his conduct when the brig was taken, and after he became
a prisoner. He could be carpenter, carver, shoe-maker,
merchant, could make boxes, sell tobacco,
or labor in any way to make a shift, to prevent starvation.
Nor did he neglect his mind; he bought several
books at extravagant prices, which he read, and loaned
to his fellow prisoners. Among other studies perused
in prison he became master of <em>navigation</em>. His journal,
which is a standing monument of his genius and industry,
was concealed, while writing, in his boots, and as
each page became full, it was conveyed to a chest with
a double bottom, and there secreted until he left prison
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>It is probable the existence of the journal was known
to very few, if any, in prison, as the most serious consequences
must have followed its discovery. How often
in the silent hours of midnight, by the light made from
the marrow of a bone, did he trace the record of each
eventful day? It has never been known that any journal
of any length of time was kept by any other person:
it is believed none exists; and to the friends of
those who were taken by the enemy and died in prison,
or escaped but have not been heard from, or who went
on board English men-of-war, “to serve, and continue
to serve in his Majesty’s service,” the journal of Mr.
Herbert must be of great interest and satisfaction.
After Mr. Herbert’s return to Newburyport, Aug. 23,
1780, we have no account of his being employed in the
service of his country, other than as a private citizen;
indeed, his constitution had received so severe a shock
by his long imprisonment and great exposure, that his
health was much enfeebled. He soon entered into business
as a block-maker, and on the 8th of November,
1783, was united in marriage to Miss <em>Molly Butler</em>, by
Rev. John Murray, of Newburyport. He continued in
the business of block-maker until his death, which occurred
on the 4th of September, A. D. 1808. Mr. Herbert
had one brother, who died in the morning of life,
by a fall occasioned by moving some freight belonging
to him on board a vessel. Mrs. Herbert became the
mother of fourteen children, six of whom are still living.
She is still, at the advanced age of eighty-four,
lingering among us as a relic of a people precious in
our memory; and should there be a surplus after paying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>the expenses of publishing this work, if still living, she
will enjoy a liberal share thereof.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is to be regretted that Mrs. Herbert has not been
able to obtain either the pension allowed by the law of
our land to widows of Revolutionary soldiers and
sailors, or the prize money due to her husband from
government. How slow are we to reward those who
struggled hard for our liberties.</p>

<p class='c000'>The above facts might be confirmed by the testimony
of some of our most distinguished citizens, if necessary.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hoping that liberal sales will enable the publisher
to render to the widow of Charles Herbert a liberal donation,
it is submitted to a generous public, by the
publisher.</p>

<p class='c011'>The brig <span class='sc'>Dolton</span> sailed from Newburyport,
November 15th, 1776, and from Portsmouth, on
the 26th of the same month, and on the 24th of
December following, about nine o’clock in the
evening, we were taken by the <em>Reasonable</em>, man-of-war,
of sixty-four guns. As her cruise was
over, she was bound to Plymouth, England. The
first lieutenant of the ship was the first man that
boarded us, and he ordered us all on board the
ship as fast as the boats could carry us, and would
give us no time to collect our clothes, promising
us, however, upon his word and honor, that we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>should have them all sent on board the next day.
Some of our company trusted to this assurance,
but I thought it not best to do the like. I was
stationed upon the main-top when we were taken,
and had not so good an opportunity to save my
clothes, as those below; yet I saved more than
any of the foremast hands; for as soon as I found
that we were taken, I made all speed from the top
down to my chest. I broke it open and shifted
myself from head to foot—putting on two shirts,
a pair of drawers and breeches, and trowsers over
them; two or three jackets, and a pair of new
shoes, and then filled my bosom and pockets as
full as I could well carry. Afterwards, I found it
was well for me that I did so; for when the
clothes were brought on board, we found that all
the best of them had been culled out, and nothing
but a few rags and a dozen old blankets were sent
to us.</p>

<p class='c000'>After we came on board, we were ordered upon
the quarter-deck, and from there down into the cable-tier,
where we found very disagreeable lodgings,
having nothing but the bare <em>cable</em> to lay upon,
and that very uneven. Besides this, we were
almost suffocated with heat. Being, however,
very much fatigued, I slept about two hours, as
soundly as if I had been upon a bed of down. When
I awoke I crawled aft upon the cable, where was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>the sentinel, and spent the remainder of the night
in conversation with him.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the morning the <em>boys</em> were called by the officers
of the ship to come upon deck. Now,
thinks I to myself, there is an advantage in being
small. I’ll embrace this opportunity, and try for
my liberty upon deck, too. Accordingly, I went
up, and no sooner were we on deck than we were
thronged about by the seamen. They told us
that a few hours after they took us, they spoke
twelve or fourteen sail of transports, bound to
New York, under convoy of a frigate, and she
had thrown her guns overboard in a storm. I
learned that the name of the Captain of the ship
which had taken us, was Thomas Fitzherbert.</p>

<p class='c000'>[The journal of the remainder of the passage to
Plymouth, England, has been lost, and the next
record commences some day or two after their arrival
in this port.]</p>

<p class='c000'>1777. January 15th. This morning our officers
were brought on board again. We hear that
the British troops have taken “Fort Washington,”
with the loss of <em>eight hundred men</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>16. A number of seamen’s wives came on
board to-day, and upon being told that they had
American prisoners on board, “Have you?” said
one to the other; “What sort of people are
they?” “Are they white?” “Can they talk?”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>Upon being pointed to where some of them stood,
“Why!” exclaimed they, “they look like our
people, and they talk English.”</p>

<p class='c000'>17. Nothing remarkable.</p>

<p class='c000'>18. To-day is the Queen’s birth-day, and every
ship in the harbor that is in commission, fired
twenty-one guns, as a royal salute.</p>

<p class='c000'>19. Sunday. To-day we were removed from
the Reasonable to the Bellisle, a ship of sixty-four
guns, after having been on board the Reasonable
twenty-seven days. Here we lodged in the
cable-tier, on boards laid over the cable, which is
better than we had on board the Reasonable.</p>

<p class='c000'>20. Nothing remarkable.</p>

<p class='c000'>22. Last Sunday, “a prize” was brought in
here, which proved to be the brig Triton, from
Newburg, Captain Tileston, master. The captain
was sent on shore and made his escape.</p>

<p class='c000'>23. Nothing occurred worthy of notice.</p>

<p class='c000'>24. To-day, two ships-of-war sailed from the
sound. The Southampton, of thirty-six guns, and
the Thetis, of thirty-two guns.</p>

<p class='c000'>25. There has been a great market on board
to-day.</p>

<p class='c000'>26. Sunday. But very little respect paid to the
day.</p>

<p class='c000'>27. The daily allowance on board His Majesty’s
ships, is: Sunday, pork and peas; Monday, birgu,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>butter and cheese; Tuesday, beef and pudding;
Wednesday, birgu and peas, butter and cheese;
Thursday, pork and peas; Friday, birgu and peas,
butter and cheese; Saturday, beef and pudding;
a pint of wine, or half a pint of rum, when at sea;
and when in port, beer in abundance, and fresh
meat twice in a week.</p>

<p class='c000'>28. To-day I received a pair of stockings, a
present from one of the seamen.</p>

<p class='c000'>30. This morning, the captain, doctor and servant,
of the privateer sloop Charming Sally,
from America, came on board this ship. They inform
us that they were taken the 16th of January,
by the None-Such, man-of-war, sixty-four guns, and
have been well used; having been on full allowance,
till they came on board this ship; and the captain
that took them allowed them all their clothes and
bedding.</p>

<p class='c000'>31. It is a time of general colds with us, and
about eighteen of our number are sick.</p>

<p class='c000'>February 1. Windy, cold, blustering, unsteady
weather.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. Nothing worthy of record.</p>

<p class='c000'>4. We are told that orders have been received
from London, to repair all the prisons along
shore.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>February</span> 5. It is a pay-day for bounty, on
board this ship, (the Bellisle,) which occasions a
great market on board.</p>

<p class='c000'>6. We begin to grow very sickly, and twenty or
thirty of us are suffering with the itch, and we are all
dreadfully infested with vermin. I make a constant
practice of examining my clothes every day,
when we are permitted to go upon deck. I often
find them swarming with these.</p>

<p class='c000'>We are informed that the Admiral was heard to
say, that no favor was to be shown to us, on account
of our orders. We are also told by some,
that we are to be removed, soon, on board the
Ocean, which is the Admiral’s ship; by others,
that we shall be removed to prison.</p>

<p class='c000'>This afternoon, about <em>one hundred</em> pressed men
were brought on board this ship.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>7. We were removed from the Bellisle, after
having been on board nineteen days, and were
carried up to Ammores, and put on board the
“Tarbay,” a ship of seventy-four guns, and confined
in the bay, between decks, where there was
not room for all of us to lay down; it is parted
off, like a sheep-pen, and takes in two side-ports
only.</p>

<p class='c000'>8. Pleasant weather, but very cold for persons
in our condition, as we are obliged to lay upon a
wet deck, without either bedding or clothes, more
than what we have on our backs—except a very
few who have an old blanket apiece. As there is
not room enough within our narrow quarters for
every one to lay down at night, some are obliged
to sit up all night.</p>

<p class='c000'>9. There are now <em>sixteen</em> of our number on the
doctor’s list, and there are but very few of us but
what are either complaining with bad colds or
rheumatic pains; and if there are ten sick with
as many different complaints, they give them all
alike the same medicine.</p>

<p class='c000'>10. Rough, cold, and some snow; all the way
we have to keep ourselves warm, in the day time,
is by play, and making ourselves merry.</p>

<p class='c000'>11. We hear that General Lee is taken. I had
to-day a handful of bread given to me by a woman,
which I <em>joyfully</em> received.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>12. We are informed that Parliament has passed
an act that all Americans taken in arms against
the King, shall be deemed rebels; and those taken
in armed vessels, upon the high seas, as pirates.</p>

<p class='c000'>13. Our company is in a very poor state of
health. Last night I sat up with one at the point
of death. We were removed to-day from the
Tarbay, after being on board six days, and carried
on board the Burford, a ship of <em>seventy-four</em>
guns. Thanks be to God for this removal, for
here we have more room, and there are but few
men belonging to the ship besides the officers.</p>

<p class='c000'>14. We are now on board the Burford, where
we find better usage than we have received since
we have been taken, and our sick have good care
taken of them. We are also allowed to go upon
deck, twenty at a time.</p>

<p class='c000'>15. This morning sailed from Ammores three
ships of the line, of seventy-four guns—the Albion,
the Boyne and the Tarbay. To-day nine of
our sick were carried on shore to the Royal Hospital.
We were informed by one of the lieutenants
of the ship, that, although their orders were
to strip and plunder us, yet we should be allowed
a bed and bedding, and such of us as had not
clothes to change ourselves, should have them;
which we may account as a favor.</p>

<p class='c000'>16. Clear and pleasant, (Sunday,) and as we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>are now between-decks, and have more room and
the light of the sun, and not confined to the
cable-tier, we have an opportunity for reading.</p>

<p class='c000'>17. Very stormy. To-day we had delivered to
us, by the purser of the ship, bedding and clothes.
I received a shirt, and bedding, consisting of a
<em>flock bed and pillows</em>, a <em>rug</em>, and <em>blankets</em>. Some,
who were almost naked, had nearly a whole suit
given them. When they gave us the shirts, they
told us to take off our old ones and throw them
overboard, “lice and all.”</p>

<p class='c000'>18. Those of us who did not receive clothes
yesterday, have received them to-day, and those
who did not receive beds, are to receive them in
a few days. Our beds are a great comfort to our
sore bodies, after laying fifty-five nights without
any—all the time since we were taken—sometimes
upon hard cables, sometimes upon boards
laid over the cables, and at other times on a wet
deck, with nothing to cover us but the clothes on
our backs. Now we have good bedding for our
comfort, thanks be to God! <em>and a good friend</em>;
for we are told that the captain of the ship, whose
name is Boyer, gave us these clothes and beds,
out of his own pocket.</p>

<p class='c000'>19. This evening the remainder of our company
received beds. We never know the true
state of our condition till it is illustrated by its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>contraries; neither do we know how to value
what we have but by the want of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>20. It is very sickly amongst us, and some one
is taken sick almost every day.</p>

<p class='c000'>21. The Reasonable came out of dock and
dropped to her moorings. The Ocean is stripped
and going into dock. The Lizard, frigate, has
lately arrived from America, and to-day was towed
up from the Sound, having cut away her masts
yesterday in a gale of wind.</p>

<p class='c000'>22. To-day a frigate sailed.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>February</span> 23. Sunday. We have an opportunity
for reading.</p>

<p class='c000'>24. Mr. Holland, the master-at-arms of the
ship, has been on shore; he informs us of the
death of one of our company—<em>Ebenezer Hunt</em>.
He died on the 20th of this month, in the Royal
Hospital; he was one of the nine that were sent
on shore the 15th inst.</p>

<p class='c000'>25. This morning Mr. Holland came into our
apartment inquiring for a joiner. I offered myself,
and went upon deck to work for him. He obtained
the liberty of the carpenter’s bench and tools,
and I went to work, getting, also, permission for
one of my acquaintances to come upon deck and
work with me. We made him a table, for which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>he gave us a bag to put our clothes in, half of a
salt fish, a quart of potatoes, six biscuits, and butter
to eat with our fish, besides a good hot supper.</p>

<p class='c000'>26. I had an opportunity of reading a newspaper
wherein was a confirmation, in several different
places, of General Lee’s being taken. I saw,
also, an Act that was moved in Parliament and
passed in the affirmative, 112 to 35; according to
which we are guilty of high treason, and are sentenced
to prison, there to lay, without bail, until
the first of January, 1778, and then to have a
trial.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>27. Last night the Boyne came up to her
mooring, having sprung a leak and carried away
her fore-topmast. She is the second, out of the three
which sailed on the 15th inst., that has returned in
distress. This ship’s guns and carriages were
brought alongside, and there were not men enough
to hoist them in; so the captain sent his compliments
to us, to see if we would assist in getting
them on board, which we willingly did, because
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>he appears to be the best friend to us that we have
met with since we have been taken.</p>

<p class='c000'>28. We had a paper wherein is an account of
the march and defeat of the King’s troops towards
Philadelphia, with the loss of fourteen or fifteen
hundred men.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>March</span> 1. Myself and one of my shipmates
have again been upon deck to work. We made a
chest for the master-at-arms, for which he gave us
some biscuit. We mended, also, a table for the
ship’s cook, for which he gave us a supper and
some spare bread and meat. It is in the paper
that the ship which brought Dr. Franklin from
Philadelphia to France, as she was returning, took
a brig laden with fish, three days out of port, belonging
to the same gentleman that bought the
Dolton.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. Prayers were read on board this ship to-day,
and we were allowed to go on deck to hear them.
A frigate arrived, after a six months’ cruise, as we
know by her firing a salute—which they are not
allowed to do unless they have been six months
absent. Myself and another have the liberty from
the carpenter of the ship to work every day when
we can get work to do.</p>

<p class='c000'>26. It is four months since we sailed from Portsmouth,
having been in that time twenty-eight days
on board the Dolton, twenty-seven days on board
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>the Reasonable, nineteen on board the Bellisle,
six on board the Tarbay, and forty-one on board
the Burford, which is our present place of abode.</p>

<p class='c000'>27. We are told that we are to go on shore to-morrow
to prison. Our company, one after another,
are daily dropping sick, and about forty of
us have the itch; but our sick have as good care
taken of them on board this ship as we could expect,
and we are visited morning and evening by
the doctor.</p>

<p class='c000'>28. I have been poorly some days past, and having
no appetite for my food I bought a quarter of
a pound of sugar to sweeten some water gruel,
which is the best that I can get here.</p>

<p class='c000'>29. To-day two more were sent on shore to the
Hospital, sick.</p>

<p class='c000'>30. Sunday. But the time is badly spent for
persons in our situation, who do not know how
soon the gallows may be our doom.</p>

<p class='c000'>31. I had sent to me, by the surgeon of the
ship, about a pound of sugar and two ounces of
tea, for some work which I did for him some time
ago, and this morning I made some tea for my
breakfast, which I drank with a good relish.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>April</span> 1. To-day I took an emetic of the doctor.
There is another one of our company attacked
with the <em>small-pox</em>, and to all human
appearances, it will go through the company. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>do not know that I ever can have it better than
now, as I am well dieted, and therefore do not
try to escape it.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. To-day the Admiral and his lady, with
several other ladies, came on board this ship to
dine. This afternoon the man with small-pox
was sent on shore, to the hospital.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. Windy, cold weather. We hear that <em>three
American</em> privateers went into Ireland, victualed
and watered, and went out again, before it was
known who they were.</p>

<p class='c000'>4. This ship is bending her sails; it is reported
that she is bound to sea soon. I suppose she is
bound to Spithead, where a number from this
place have gone.</p>

<p class='c000'>5. Last evening the master-at-arms told us that
we were to go on shore to-day at ten o’clock, but
we are not there yet. To-day we had an opportunity
of reading a newspaper, wherein is an account
of the Americans taking nine hundred
Hessian troops, on Christmas evening. As we
are not allowed a paper, when we get one we are
obliged to be very cautious how and when we
read it.</p>

<p class='c000'>6. Sunday. Again there has been prayers on
board this ship, and a sermon preached. Another
one of our company has broken out with the small-pox.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>7. To-day the man with the small-pox was sent
on shore.</p>

<p class='c000'>8. There is another broken out with small-pox,
and I expect every day to be attacked myself.</p>

<p class='c000'>9. Two more of our company are quite unwell,
and we expect it is small-pox. A lad who stole,
and was obliged to run the gauntlet twice before,
stole again, and to-day was punished in the same
manner.</p>

<p class='c000'>10. To-day three more were sent on shore with
the small-pox, and three returned from the Hospital
well, who were carried on shore the 15th of
February. They tell us that they were used well.
We hear that Captain Joseph Rowe has been taken
in the ship “<em>Nancy</em>,” from Newbury, and has
been brought in here. He has now his liberty on
shore, but his men are on board the Ocean, which
is the Admiral’s ship.</p>

<p class='c000'>11. To-day the same lad who has stolen and run
the gauntlet three times before, stole again; and
we took another method with him. We tied him
up, and our boatswain’s mate gave him two dozen
with the cat, on his bare back. At the least computation,
in the three times which he run the gauntlet,
exclusive of the punishment he received to-day,
he must have had seven or eight hundred
lashes, with hard nettles, on a bare back.</p>

<p class='c000'>12. Pleasant weather. To-day <em>eight</em> more of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>our company were carried on shore to the Royal
Hospital, with the <em>itch</em>, and myself amongst the
number. Alas! little did I think, six months ago,
that I should ever set my foot on this island. It
is four months and seventeen days since I left
Portsmouth, all of which time I have been on the
water. There are now twenty-four of our company
in these hospitals, some with the small-pox,
and the rest with the <em>itch</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>13. Sunday. I have been taking sulphur, to
prepare for anointing this evening.</p>

<p class='c000'>14. The first day I came here I was put upon
diet; I had only half a pound of bread and a
quart of milk, but now I am put on full allowance,
which is a pound of beef, a pound of potatoes,
and three pints of beer, per day.</p>

<p class='c000'>15. We take a large spoonful of sulphur mixed
with honey and cream tartar, morning and evening,
and in the evening also use the ointment.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>April</span> 16. Within these hospital wards there are
<em>ten grand buildings</em>, three stories high. Each
building contains six wards, each ward can accommodate
twenty-five patients—so that there is
room for fifteen hundred patients, besides attendants.</p>

<p class='c000'>To-day our food, with our names entered in a
book, was sent, which was headed, “Upon such a
day a ward was opened for the <em>rebel prisoners</em>;” I
scratched out the word rebel and wrote American.
When the book was returned, a messenger was sent
with sixpence reward for any one who would tell
who did it, but he returned no wiser than he
came.</p>

<p class='c000'>17. There are now fifteen of us in this ward,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>and seven are upon what they call half-diet, (on
account of their drawing coals and candles;) so
that every other day we draw a half a pound of
mutton, a pound of bread, a pound of potatoes, and
a pound of greens.</p>

<p class='c000'>18. To-day there are two more of our company
brought on shore, with the itch.</p>

<p class='c000'>19. I am very unwell; I have a bad pain in my
head and back—the symptoms of small-pox—and
the doctor ordered me something to take, immediately.</p>

<p class='c000'>20. I have had six applications for the itch, but
am not half cured; and to-day when the doctor
came in to see me, he told me I had the small-pox,
and ordered the nurse to remove me immediately,
into the small-pox ward, which she did. After I
got there, I was ordered to strip off all the dirty
clothes that I had upon me. I washed myself in
warm water, and put on a clean linen shirt, a
woollen gown, waistcoat and drawers, and turned
into bed with clean sheets.</p>

<p class='c000'>21. I feel something better, and my pock comes
out very fast; but it is the small sort, which is the
worst.</p>

<p class='c000'>Also, last evening three prisoners made their
escape from the fifty-sixth ward, which is the same
I left yesterday.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>22. This morning got up, but my pock has come
out exceedingly thick.</p>

<p class='c000'>23. We are informed that the men who ran
away are taken.</p>

<p class='c000'>24. I am broken out so very thick, and the
ointment for the itch inflamed my blood so much,
that my flesh feels as if I was raked up in a bed
of embers; and I am so sick at my stomach that I
vomit up every thing I eat, and am unable to write.</p>

<p class='c000'>25. Kept my bed, and was in great pain.</p>

<p class='c000'>26. My head was swollen very much, and I was
so blind that I could scarcely see daylight.</p>

<p class='c000'>27. My pock was almost to the full.</p>

<p class='c000'>28. I feel easier as to pain.</p>

<p class='c000'>29. My pock begins to turn.</p>

<p class='c000'>30. I was very easy as to pain, but so very sore
that I could scarcely lay in bed.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>May</span> 1. I got up, but was hardly able to walk.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. I got up again, but my legs and feet swell
very much.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. To-day I feel something better.</p>

<p class='c000'>4. I am some better, and got up again, but was
unable to sit up long; my pock begins to dry very
well, and my swelling to go down.</p>

<p class='c000'>5. This morning Joseph Hatch, one of our
company, died with small-pox. He is the second
of our company that has died in these hospitals.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>6. I begin to grow bravely, and have a very good
appetite for my victuals. I remain very sore, yet
not so sore as I was two or three days ago; as my
pock ran all together then, when I used to rise up
in bed to receive any thing, and stuck to my linen
and the sheets, so that it would tear off the scab
from the whole length of my back, when I arose.</p>

<p class='c000'>7. I am very sore yet, but am doing finely, considering
that it is with some difficulty that I can
get to the table to write; and I have a good appetite
to eat. I asked the doctor for mutton, which
he granted, so that I now have a pound of bread,
half a pound of mutton, and a quart of beer.</p>

<p class='c000'>8. There are two of our company now in this
ward, very sick with the small-pox; but they have
faithful care taken of them by the nurses, and the
doctor is very kind. He allows them near half a
pint of wine, or a small bottle of cordial, almost
every day. The nurses, also, have been, and still
are, <em>very kind to me</em>. When I first came into this
ward, I brought a little tea and sugar with me,
which I obtained on board the ships, and after it
was all expended, the nurses gave me out of their
own stores, tea twice a day, or as often as they
make it for themselves.</p>

<p class='c000'>[Mr. Herbert often in after life spoke in the
highest terms of the kindness and attention of the
nurses.]</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>9. Near half the scab has come off my body,
and every morning when I get up, there is near a
handful of scab left in the sheet, which comes off
in the night.</p>

<p class='c000'>10. I have several biles upon my legs, which
cause a great deal of pain.</p>

<p class='c000'>11. My legs are very sore, so that I am obliged
to have them bound up from my ancles to my
hips.</p>

<p class='c000'>12. I am indifferently well, except my legs and
thighs, where I have nearly a dozen biles, with
which I am so lame I can scarcely walk.</p>

<p class='c000'>13. To-day I took another portion of physic,
which makes the sixth.</p>

<p class='c000'>14. There are now twenty-six Americans here.
Some are almost well of the small-pox, and have
gone below into the recovering ward.</p>

<p class='c000'>15. It is six months to-day since I left Newbury,
and I fear it will be six more before I return.</p>

<p class='c000'>16. To-day I took the seventh portion of physic.</p>

<p class='c000'>17. This morning, died here, one Ebenezer
Willis. He was a young man taken with Captain
Brown, in the sloop Charming Sally. Also, this
afternoon, of small-pox, Samuel Shriggings, he being
the <em>third</em> of our company that has died in these
hospitals, and the second in this ward, since I have
been in it.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>18. Last evening three of our company in the
fifty-sixth ward, attempted to make their escape,
but were discovered and taken before they got
over the wall.</p>

<p class='c000'>19. To-day I took my eighth portion of physic.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>May</span> 20. There is a great frolic near by, called
a bull-bating. We have a view of the people, but
not of their sport.</p>

<p class='c000'>We hear that the prisons are ready for the reception
of the rebel prisoners, as we are called, and I
daily expect our company to come on shore to
them.</p>

<p class='c000'>21. I gather strength, but as yet I am so weak
as to be able to walk but very little. My chief
employment is reading, but my eyes are weak,
caused by rubbing them when I was almost blind.</p>

<p class='c000'>22. There are two other Americans now in this
ward, very sick with the small-pox; and one or
two of our company, who are very sick.</p>

<p class='c000'>23. I took my ninth portion of physic.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>24. It is six weeks to-day since I came on
shore, and five weeks to-morrow since I was
brought into this building with small-pox. To-day
I asked the doctor for some beef, which he
granted; he also ordered me to go below into the
recovering ward.</p>

<p class='c000'>25. To-day I was upon full allowance, and drew
a pound of beef, a pound of bread, a pound of potatoes,
and three pints of beer.</p>

<p class='c000'>26. This morning about seven o’clock, died
James Jutson, an old man, prisoner from the
Queen, taken with Captain Brown in the privateer
sloop Charming Sally.</p>

<p class='c000'>27. To-day we were forbidden the liberty of
going up stairs to speak to our sick shipmates.</p>

<p class='c000'>28. Yesterday, seven of Captain Brown’s crew
were sent to prison, from the ship, and Captain
Brown made his escape from the “Fountain Tavern,”
in Plymouth Dock, where they were sent to
be tried. Also, to-day took my tenth portion of
physic.</p>

<p class='c000'>29. To-day twelve of us were discharged from
the hospital, but the boat did not come for us. We
hear that the Bellisle has arrived in the Sound,
has the yellow fever on board, and has been laid
under quarantine, in the Sound, some time.</p>

<p class='c000'>30. As we were discharged yesterday, and the
boat did not come for us, to-day we were put upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>what they call cazzelteer, and only draw half a
pound of bread and a quart of milk. A prisoner
in the middle story, last night, being very sick with
the small-pox got out of his bed, threw up the window
and jumped out. He fell head first, about
twenty feet, upon the hard ground, bruising himself
sadly.</p>

<p class='c000'>31. It is now seven weeks since I came on
shore, and six weeks to-day since I was brought
here with small-pox.</p>

<p class='c000'>June 1. It being pleasant weather, the nurse
permitted me to walk in the garden.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. We expected to have been removed, either to
the ships or to prison, but were not.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. To-day we were again discharged, but the
boat did not come for us. Last night, one William
Woodward, a prisoner, taken in the sloop
Charming Sally, made his escape from this ward.</p>

<p class='c000'>4. As we were discharged yesterday, and the
boat did not come for us, we were again put upon
cazzelteers and draw only a quart of milk, and a
half pound of bread.</p>

<p class='c000'>To-day is the King’s birth-day, and there is
great firing of cannon, and chiming of bells, in
Dock and Plymouth.</p>

<p class='c000'>This morning about three o’clock, another prisoner
died of small-pox—the same person who
jumped from the window, as before mentioned.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>He was taken in the privateer sloop Charming Sally.
After he was dead, his coffin was brought,
which proved to be near six inches too short. But
rather than have another made, they jammed him
into that, in a most shocking manner.</p>

<p class='c000'>5. This morning early, the boat came for us
and twelve of us went on board and were
carried along side the Blenheim, to which ship
our company, and that of Captain Brown, had been
removed since we went on shore. Four of the
twelve that were in the boat belonged to the captain’s
crew. They were put on board the Blenheim,
but the rest of us were carried on shore again,
and guarded to the Fountain Tavern, to be tried
by the judges; for that is the place where they sit.
We were put into a small room, surrounded by a
guard, and having eat nothing through the day,
were very weak; so we got the soldiers to boil us
a little meat, which we had obtained at the hospital.
After this, we were all called up before the
judges and examined. They asked each of us in
what province we had been born, and whether or
not we had a commission from Congress? At
what time we entered on board the Dolton? Whether
we were taken by the Reasonable? To each
of their questions we answered. We were then
sent below into the little room again; then we were
called up the second time, one at a time, and asked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>the same questions, to which we answered. They
then read them over to us, and asked us if it was
true, to which we replied it was. We told them we
were out to fight the enemies of the thirteen United
States. After we were examined one by one,
the third time, we were all called up together,
as at the first, and our commitments were read to
us and delivered to the constable. My commitment
read as follows:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Charles Herbert, you are supposed to be guilty
of the crime of high treason, and committed to
prison for the same until the time of trial.”</p>

<p class='c000'>We were then delivered to the constable, and
guarded to Old Mill Prison, Plymouth.</p>

<p class='c000'>Alas! I have entered the gates but the Lord only
knows when I shall go out of them again.</p>

<p class='c000'>June 6. Our allowance here in prison is a pound
of bread, a quarter of a pound of beef, a pound of
greens, a quart of beer and a little pot-liquor that
the beef and greens are boiled in, without any
thickening,—per day.</p>

<p class='c000'>7. Pleasant weather, but we are kept in all day
as a punishment for a misbeholden word spoken
to the sentry on guard.</p>

<p class='c000'>8. Sunday; and there has been a great number
of persons at the gate to see us, who gave in, for
our relief, several shillings.</p>

<p class='c000'>9. Rainy weather, so that we keep house all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>day, except when we go out to draw our provisions.</p>

<p class='c000'>10. There have about ten or twelve prisoners
come from the ships to prison to-day. Having so
lately had the small-pox, and being so long physiced
afterwards, I require more victuals now, than
I ever did before; and our allowance is so very
small, and having only sevenpence left of what little
money I had when I came to prison, I had a
continual gnawing at my stomach; and I find that
unless I take some method to obtain something
more than my bare allowance, I must certainly
suffer, if not die, and that soon. As necessity is
the mother of invention, I am resolved to try to
get something, and to-day when a carpenter came
to put in a window at the end of the prison, I entreated
him to bring me some deal, and I would
make him a box, which he did.</p>

<p class='c000'>11. To-day we have made a charity-box, and
put it up at the gate. There is written upon it,
“Health, Plenty, and Competence to the donors.”
I have finished the box for the carpenter, and he
likes it so well that he wants more made, and he
brought me some more wood for that purpose,—some
for him, and some for myself.</p>

<p class='c000'>12. I have been busy all day making boxes, and
some of the prisoners are making punch ladles,
spoons, chairs, and the like; for which they, now
and then, get a shilling.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>13. We have chosen a purser amongst ourselves
to take charge of the avails of the charity-box.
Some days we get four or five shillings, and upon
others, not more than four or five pence.</p>

<p class='c000'>14. To-day we drew only half a pound of greens.
They tell us it is by the order of the board; our
meat is very short, and our broth only the pot-liquor
with the fat skimmed off.</p>

<p class='c000'>15. Last night the guard was alarmed. They
supposed that they heard noises as if we were
breaking out of prison; this is the second time this
guard has been alarmed when we were all silent.</p>

<p class='c000'>16. Wet weather, so that we keep house.</p>

<p class='c000'>17. I have been employed for several days past,
making boxes, and carving them. To-day I sold
two, one for a shilling, the other for ninepence.</p>

<p class='c000'>18. To-day there have been several gentlemen
and ladies to see us, and they gave us several small
books; I sold, also, another box for a shilling.</p>

<p class='c000'>19. There is one of the prisoners who has been
unwell for several days, and is now broke out with
the small-pox.</p>

<p class='c000'>20. There are about ten prisoners brought to
prison nearly every day; but there are only a few
more to come.</p>

<p class='c000'>21. I have now got into such a way of making
boxes and selling them, that I can afford to buy
myself a breakfast every morning; commonly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>bread and milk, which is brought to prison every
morning for sale.</p>

<p class='c000'>22. Sunday; there have been great numbers of
people to see us, and the prison guard, confederating
with the turnkey, have got a box put up at the
gate, and they will let no one look in to see us,
without paying in a certain amount. To-day we
are told that they got fifteen shillings in their box,
which they divided among themselves; but the
people who put it in thought it was for the prisoners.
We, therefore, took in our box, and are
resolved to put it out no more.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>June</span> 23. To-day we divided the money which
we had got in our charity-box, and it was only five
farthings per man.</p>

<p class='c000'>24. To-day there were two more prisoners
brought in; they were taken in France. Having
been invited on board an English vessel, and not
knowing who they were, went on board, and were
immediately seized and confined. The vessel
then weighed anchor and came out of the harbor.
The prisoners proved to be the captain and lieutenant
of a Virginia pilot boat. The captain is
now confined in the yard, in a prison by himself,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>and is not allowed to speak to us, but the lieutenant
is in prison with us.</p>

<p class='c000'>25. Rainy weather.</p>

<p class='c000'>26. Continued wet, so that we keep house.</p>

<p class='c000'>27. To-day another broke out with small-pox.</p>

<p class='c000'>28. To-day Captain Ross, one of our prize-masters,
had a present of some bread and cheese.</p>

<p class='c000'>29. Sunday. To-day there have been great
numbers to see us, but they were disappointed;
for they kept the outer gate shut, and would not
let the people look at us.</p>

<p class='c000'>30. We are so confined here that we are out of
the way of all news; we are not allowed a newspaper,
and at present no one is allowed to come to
the gate to speak to us. The week past, I have
received three shillings and two pence, for boxes.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>July</span> 1. Nothing remarkable.</p>

<p class='c000'>2, 3. Very rainy, so that we are obliged to
keep house.</p>

<p class='c000'>4. Fair weather. This is the only fair day we
have had for nearly a week; and to-day a fleet of
transports with troops, bound to America, put in
here for a harbor.</p>

<p class='c000'>5. To-day several American gentlemen came to
see us. They came to England before the war
began; they gave considerable money to some
with whom they were acquainted; to one they
gave <em>two</em> guineas, to another <em>one</em>, to another half
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>a guinea, and to three more five shillings apiece.
The week past I have received one shilling and
two pence for boxes.</p>

<p class='c000'>6. Sunday. A great number of persons came
to see us, but the gate was kept shut, so they
could not speak to us, or give us any thing;
but some that were in prison took a small bag
and tied a string to it and let it down at a
window at the back side of the prison. About a
sixpence was put into it, but the guard came in
and forbid it.</p>

<p class='c000'>7. They have placed lanterns all round the prison
yard, for fear that some of us should make our
escape in the night.</p>

<p class='c000'>8. Last night the guard became alarmed by our
people laughing and singing, and they came in
and took one of the prisoners to the <em>Black-hole</em>,
a place of punishment so called, where he is to
lay <em>forty days</em>, on half allowance, and nothing to
sleep on but the ground. We were all threatened
to be put on half allowance. This afternoon there
sailed from the Sound a fleet of transports of about
thirty sail, and three convoys, bound to America.
According to the best accounts, there are about
four thousand troops on board.</p>

<p class='c000'>9,10,11. Warm and pleasant weather. Nothing
remarkable.</p>

<p class='c000'>12. Last night, four of the prisoners that were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>in the hospital, one that was in the Black-hole, and
one from a prison where there are a number using
applications for the itch, made their escape through
a drain that leads to the river edge. For this
week past I have received three shillings and sixpence
for boxes and ladles.</p>

<p class='c000'>13. Sunday. Those who remain in the itch
apartment are all put on half allowance, to make
them tell which way the man got out who made
his escape from that building; and a sentinel is
set before the prison to keep us from giving them
any thing, or speaking to them.</p>

<p class='c000'>14. The Yarmouth, a ship of seventy-four
guns, dropped down into the Sound, in order for
sailing.</p>

<p class='c000'>15. The prisoners in the itch apartment told the
agent which way the man got out of prison, and
were put upon their usual allowance.</p>

<p class='c000'>16. We hear of the death of Thomas Rines, one
of our company, whom I left sick at the Royal Hospital;
he died of the small-pox, and is the fourth
of our company who has died since we were taken.</p>

<p class='c000'>17. Several in prison have broken out with the
small-pox, all of whom inoculated themselves
from the first that were attacked with it.</p>

<p class='c000'>18. There has been a great deal of talk of a
French war ever since we have been taken, and it
appears now to be very near, for the English vessels
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>are often receiving insults at sea from the
French. Three years ago they would have resented
this, but now they appear to be afraid.</p>

<p class='c000'>19. The remainder of the prisoners who have
not had the small pox have had an offer from the
doctor to be inoculated.</p>

<p class='c000'>20. Last night we made a breech in the prison
wall, and began to dig out, which we expect will
take near a fortnight to accomplish, as we have
near eighteen feet to dig under ground to get into
a field on the other side of the wall.</p>

<p class='c000'>21. For the week past I have received, for boxes
and ladles, two shillings and sixpence.</p>

<p class='c000'>22. The hole that is now in hand is to be only
just large enough for a man to crowd himself out.
The men that dig it have made great progress
since they have been at work; we put all the dirt
into our chests, as we have several of them in
prison, and when they leave work they stop up the
hole with the same stones that came out, and
daub it over with lime, so that it appears like the
other wall.</p>

<p class='c000'>23. Last evening transports arrived here from
America, with six hundred wounded marines on
board.</p>

<p class='c000'>24. We had a present sent us of several pounds
of leaf tobacco.</p>

<p class='c000'>25. To-day three of the number who broke out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>of the sick ward, on the 12th of this month, were
brought back again, and put in the Black-hole,
there to lay forty days, on half allowance.</p>

<p class='c000'>20. We hear that Captain Manley, of the Hancock
frigate, has taken the Fox frigate, of twenty-eight
guns.</p>

<p class='c000'>27. For the week past I have received eighteen-pence
for boxes.</p>

<p class='c000'>29. The remainder of the prisoners who have
not had the small-pox, removed into a seperate
building, in order for inoculation.</p>

<p class='c000'>30. Although we are not allowed newspapers,
yet we have them almost weekly, and we now
have one that gives an account of the before
mentioned frigate being taken; also of Captain
Giddson, in the “Civil Usage,” being seen off the
Lizzard.</p>

<p class='c000'>August 1. To-day six more of our people came
on shore from the ship; the occasion of their not
being brought to prison sooner was, that they were
detained with small-pox in the Royal Hospital.
One of these is yet very unwell, and has been put
in the prison hospital.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. We learn, by those who came in yesterday,
that Captain Adams, who was taken in a merchantman,
was set at liberty last Sunday. The
week past I have received two shillings for boxes.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>3. Sunday. The number of prisoners now in
these wards, is one hundred and seventy-three.</p>

<p class='c000'>4. Some of our people who first broke out with
small-pox in prison, are so far recovered as to be
able to come up from the hospital.</p>

<p class='c000'>5. Pleasant to-day, but stormy last night; during
the storm, some of our people made their escape
through the hole which they began to dig on
the nineteenth of last month. This hole is dug
eighteen feet under ground, and comes up in a
field the other side of the wall. Thirty-two in number
went out, three of whom have been brought
back. We are told that they have five pounds
bounty for taking up any rebel prisoner that attempts
an escape; and when taken, the prisoners
are to be put on half allowance, and placed in the
Black-hole for forty days.</p>

<p class='c000'>6. To-day one more was brought back that went
out night before last.</p>

<p class='c000'>7. Four more were brought in to-day, so that
there are eight out of the thirty-two taken already.
The four who were brought back to-day are put
in with us, as the Black-hole is full, but they will
be put on half allowance, the same as if in the
Black-hole.</p>

<p class='c000'>8. The guards are now so very suspicious of
us, that they number us two or three times a day,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>and visit us as often by night; and once or twice
they will overhaul all our chests to see that there
is no dirt in them, or any tools secreted that we
can dig out with. To-day an old man was put into
the Black-hole for only complaining that our
meat was not good.</p>

<p class='c000'>9. To-day there was one more brought back
that passed under the wall. For the week past
I have received three shillings for boxes.</p>

<p class='c000'>10. We hear that an American privateer is taken.</p>

<p class='c000'>11. To-day nine more prisoners came on shore
to the prison from the Blenheim. Eight of the
number were taken in one of Captain Weeks’
prizes, bound to France; the other was one of
our company, who has been sick at the Royal
Hospital. They inform us that Captain John Lee
is taken in the brig Fancy, twelve guns, fitted out
at Newbury, belonging to the Traceys, and forty-two
of his hands came on board the Blenheim before
they left her. To-day two more were brought
back who went out at the hole.</p>

<p class='c000'>12. To-day eight more prisoners came to the
prison from the Blenheim; three of the number
were taken in the Fancy with Captain Lee. They
inform us that they were chased on shore at
Mount Bay, near Land’s-end, by the Fieutryant,
a ship of eighty-four guns. They are only about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>eight weeks from America, and had taken four
prizes.</p>

<p class='c000'>13. Ten more of Captain Lee’s men came to
prison.</p>

<p class='c000'>14. Ten more were brought to-day.</p>

<p class='c000'>15. To-day Captain Lee and his first and second
lieutenants came to prison. From Captain Lee
I hear of the health of my friends.</p>

<p class='c000'>16. A number more of Captain Lee’s men
came to prison to-day.</p>

<p class='c000'>17. Sunday. For the week past I have received
six shillings and three pence for boxes and ladles.</p>

<p class='c000'>18. Warm and pleasant, so that we carried our
hammocks out into the yard to air. The remainder
of Captain Lee’s men were brought to prison.
Those who came to-day were the last who were
taken after they got on shore. They inform us
that they are all here now except their doctor,
who, in all probability, has made his escape.</p>

<p class='c000'>19. To-day three more were brought to prison
who belonged to the Literal Mark, fitted out of
Philadelphia.</p>

<p class='c000'>20. Warm and pleasant weather, so that we can
comfortably go barefoot; but many of us would
be obliged to do so if it were in the middle of
winter, for want of stockings and shoes.</p>

<p class='c000'>21. To-day fourteen of Captain Lee’s men,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>who have not had the small-pox, were inoculated.
The prisoners who are on half allowance have had
a meal of victuals sent them by some friend.</p>

<p class='c000'>22. We hear that Ticonderoga is taken by the
King’s troops, and also Philadelphia; that the
Hancock, Captain Manley, is taken, and the Fox
retaken; but we cannot tell what to believe by
what we hear; for since we have been taken we
have heard, nearly twenty times, that Philadelphia
was taken, and as many times that Washington
was killed; that Congress was divided, that continental
money was disgraced, that the Americans
had laid down their arms, and that they were
starving to death for want of provisions, and naked
for want of clothing; all these things have
been published in the newspapers, times without
number, since we have been taken.</p>

<p class='c000'>23. For the week past I have received three
shillings for boxes.</p>

<p class='c000'>24. Sunday. This is the greatest market day
for our wooden ware, as most people come on
this day to see us.</p>

<p class='c000'>25. Yesterday Daniel Cottle died in the prison
hospital of the small-pox; he is the sixth of our
company that has died since we have been in
England.</p>

<p class='c000'>26. It is reported that general Prescott is taken
by the Americans.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>August</span> 27. Last night, as our people who are
on half allowance in a separate prison, were trying
to dig out, the guard went in and caught them.
Two of these are now confined in the Black-hole.
To-day a prize was brought in here; she appears
to be a small brig.</p>

<p class='c000'>30. For the week past, I have received four
shillings for boxes.</p>

<p class='c000'>31. Sunday. To-day we had a newspaper, wherein
was a confirmation of Ticonderoga and Philadelphia
being taken; also, of the Hancock frigate
and Fox being retaken; this news is very disagreeable
to us, for we are sorry to hear of the enemy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>being in any way victorious; for should they
conquer the country, or even get the upper hands
of it, we are positive that the gallows or the East
Indies will be our destiny. But as to conquering
the country, it never disturbed, for me, an hour’s
rest, though it appears that they are in a fairer way
for doing it now, than ever before. We have
trouble enough here, without hearing bad news;
for it is enough to break the heart of a stone to
see so many strong, hearty men, almost starved to
death through want of provisions. A great part of
those in prison, eat at one meal what they draw
for twenty long hours, and then go without until
the next day. Many are strongly tempted to
pick up the grass in the yard, and eat it, and some
pick up old bones in the yard, that have been laying
in the dirt a week or ten days, and pound them
to pieces and suck them. Some will pick up snails
out of the holes in the wall, and from among the
grass and weeds in the yard, boil them and eat
them, and drink the broth. Often the cooks, after
they have picked over our cabbage, will cut off
some of the but-ends of the stalks and throw them
over the gate into the yard, and I have often seen,
after a rain, when the mud would be over shoes,
as these stumps were thrown over the gate, the
men running from all parts of the yard, regardless
of the mud, to catch at them, and nearly trample
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>one another under feet to get a piece. These same
cabbage stumps, hogs in America would scarcely
eat if they had them; and as to our broth, I know
very well hogs in America would scarcely put their
noses into it. Our meat is very poor in general;
we scarcely see a good piece once in a month.
Many are driven to such necessity by want of provisions,
that they have sold most of the clothes off
their backs for the sake of getting a little money to
buy them some bread. I find it very hard, myself,
but it is not so hard with me and a few others, who
have got into a way of making boxes and punch
ladles, for which we get a trifle, as it is with the
prisoners, in general, who are obliged to live upon
their allowance; but I expect that boxes and punch
ladles will soon become an old thing, for many
who buy them now, buy them more out of charity
than any thing else.</p>

<p class='c000'>September 1. Nothing remarkable, but repeated
confirmation of the before-mentioned sad
news.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. We are informed by a friend, that he is fearful
that we shall be distributed on board of His
Majesty’s ships.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. There is one of our company who lays very
ill with small-pox, but all Captain Lee’s men, who
were inoculated, are better.</p>

<p class='c000'>4. Last night Gideon Warren, one of our company,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>died of small-pox, in the prison hospital. He
is the sixth of our company who has died since
we were taken—five of the number died of small-pox.</p>

<p class='c000'>5. To-day the carpenters have been at work,
altering the hanging of our hammocks, to make
them hang on the middle rail, for fear that we
should make a breach in the wall and conceal the
same by our hammocks hanging against it until
we make our escape.</p>

<p class='c000'>6. For the week past, I have received one shilling
and ninepence, for boxes.</p>

<p class='c000'>7. Sunday. We were threatened to be put on
half allowance, on account of the orders being
torn, which are put up in the prison.</p>

<p class='c000'>8. Several who have recovered from small-pox,
came up from the hospital.</p>

<p class='c000'>9. To-day two large ships sailed from the
Sound.</p>

<p class='c000'>10. This morning, early, while some of our
people were digging out, the guard came upon
them, and we were all immediately turned out and
searched, and all our knives taken from us, that
they could find; some other tools, and some paper
which they found in prison, as we are not allowed
paper, pens or ink; but I passed the search
with two knives and my journal about me. Captain
Bird, captain of a packet bound to America,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>came to see us, and offered to carry letters for
us.</p>

<p class='c000'>11. Eleven of Captain Lee’s men came up from
the hospital, recovered from the small-pox, after
being inoculated.</p>

<p class='c000'>12. To-day a commissioner came here from
London. He told us, with other business, he came
to see us righted about our provisions; he said
that he lodged twenty-five miles distant last night,
on purpose to be here at the time of our drawing
our provisions. He also gave us liberty, whenever
we wished to make our grievances known, to
write to the Board, without inspection by the agent.</p>

<p class='c000'>13. To-day we wrote our petition to the Board,
for redress of grievances, and it was read before
the prisoners. Also, we had a paper, wherein was
a melancholy account of the barbarous treatment
of American prisoners, taken at Ticonderoga, and
an account of the Indians in Burgoyne’s army
proving treacherous.</p>

<p class='c000'>14. Sunday. The week past I have received
three shillings for boxes.</p>

<p class='c000'>15. For nearly a month past, the carpenter, of
whom I have had my wood, has not been here, so
that I have been working a chest up into boxes,
on shares. When finished and sold, it brought
nearly thirty-two shillings; but I have had a partner
to work with me, and one third of the avails
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>we paid for the chest, so that only one third belonged
to myself.</p>

<p class='c000'>16. Mr. Bell, the commissioner, has been here
again, and measured our cans, in which we draw
our beer, and he says he shall come again and try
the weights and measures by which we draw our
provisions. To-day about twenty old countrymen
petitioned the Board for permission to go on board
His Majesty’s ships.</p>

<p class='c000'>17. To-day the bells have been chiming in
Plymouth and Dock, on the election of a new
Lord Mayor.</p>

<p class='c000'>18. Yesterday some friends, from without,
sent victuals to those men who are on short allowance,
but the agent would not let them come in.</p>

<p class='c000'>19. The commissioner has again been here; he
came precisely at the time of drawing our meat.
We complained to him about the market, and he
told us that no one should be allowed to retail any
thing out to us, but that there should be an open
market at the gate, three hours in a day. Also,
those knives that were taken away a few days ago,
were handed in again.</p>

<p class='c000'>20. For the week past, I have received one shilling
and eightpence for boxes.</p>

<p class='c000'>21. Sunday. Last evening about nine o’clock,
it being very dark, a number attempted to get over
the wall by the help of a line, but as the sixth man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>was getting over, they were discovered, and three
of the number immediately taken.</p>

<p class='c000'>22. To-day is the King’s coronation day, and
each ship in commission, in the harbor, fired a
salute.</p>

<p class='c000'>23. To-day the masons have been at work, building
the wall higher where the men got over.</p>

<p class='c000'>24. Pleasant weather.</p>

<p class='c000'>25. We are informed that the Lexington, privateer,
Captain Henry Johnston, of sixteen guns, is
taken by a cutter of ten guns.</p>

<p class='c000'>26. Last evening one of our company made an
attempt to get over the wall, but no sooner was
he over than he was discovered and taken.
The commissioner again visited us, and spoke in
particular to each of our requests. He informed
us that a newspaper could not be allowed us, and
that persons on half allowance must not be helped
by any donations; he told us that he had written
to the Board for an addition of a quarter of a pound
of beef to a man; and as cold weather was coming
on, for shoes and stockings for such as are destitute.
Since this gentleman has been in town, our
provisions have been much better than they were
before. This afternoon, Captain Johnston, of the
Lexington privateer, and six of his officers, were
brought to prison in a coach.</p>

<p class='c000'>27. Ten more of Captain Johnston’s men came
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>to prison to-day. They inform us that they were
taken by a ten gun cutter after almost four hours’
engagement, and having expended all their shot;
they were so disabled by having their shrouds,
stays, and braces shot away, and so nearly
wrecked, that they were obliged to strike to their
inferiors. They had six men killed and a number
wounded; their first lieutenant had an arm
shot off, and after they were taken they were not
stripped as our company had been, but were allowed
all their clothes; and Captain Johnston was
allowed even to wear his hanger, which he brought
to prison with him, and delivered to the agent.
He had considerable money with him, which the
agent took, and he is to have it in small quantities
as he wants it, for immediate use.</p>

<p class='c000'>28. Sunday. Two large men-of-war came up
from the Sound to Ammoors; also, a frigate arrived
in the Sound, dismasted.</p>

<p class='c000'>29. Michaelmas day.</p>

<p class='c000'>30. Within a few days, three East Indiamen
arrived here, and we are told that a great part of
their men are pressed on board of the men-of-war.
This afternoon a number more of Captain Johnston’s
men were brought to prison.</p>

<p class='c000'>October 1. A number more of Captain Johnston’s
men came to prison; they inform us that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>the Frenchmen which they had on board, are not
likely to come to prison. There were about twenty
of them.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. Captain Lee, being unwell, was sent to the
hospital.</p>

<p class='c000'>4. To-day the remainder of Captain Johnston’s
men came to prison, except the Frenchmen.</p>

<p class='c000'>5. Sunday. Pleasant weather.</p>

<p class='c000'>6. To-day one of our company was brought
back, who made his escape over the wall on the
20th of last month. This is the fourth time that
this man has tried to escape without success.</p>

<p class='c000'>7. The father and mother of one of Captain
Lee’s men came to see him; they had not seen
each other before, for nearly fifteen years.</p>

<p class='c000'>8. One of the officers of the Fieutryant came to
prison to see Captain Lee. He informed us that
they have been cruising two hundred and fifty
leagues to the westward, and have taken one of
the schooner Hawk’s prizes.</p>

<p class='c000'>9. When the commissioner was here, we requested
of him the privilege of two men per day,
to go into the cook-room and cut up our meat,
and see it put into the copper, which he granted.</p>

<p class='c000'>10. Warm and pleasant</p>

<p class='c000'>11. To-day the captains of the Burford and
Fieutryant came to see us.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>12. Sunday. Of late, there have not been so
many people to see us as formerly.</p>

<p class='c000'>13. To-day our agent has been in a very good
humor, and he informed us that there is great expectation
of a French war, and within a few days
there have been four ships of the first class put in
commission, and orders have come from London
to man them as quickly as possible. He also tells
us that he has had a letter from the commissioner,
which says that Mr. Knapp, and another Newbury
man, who made their escape from this place on
the 5th of August last, are taken up.</p>

<p class='c000'>14. To-day a mess of us bought a bag of potatoes,
containing seventeen gallons, for three
shillings, which is much cheaper than to buy them
at the gate for fourpence a gallon.</p>

<p class='c000'>15. It is eleven months to-day since we sailed
from Newburyport.</p>

<p class='c000'>16. To-day a Marblehead man came to see us,
who has been on board the men-of-war ever since
the disturbance. He informs us that there are a
few Marblehead men on board the Blenheim.</p>

<p class='c000'>17. This afternoon there were seven more prisoners
brought on shore to prison; some of whom
belong to the schooner Hawk’s prize, that was taken
by the Fieutryant, and the rest belong to the Oliver
Cromwell privateer, that was taken by the
Beaver sloop-of-war.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>18. We learn by those who came to prison last,
that Dr. Franklin has written to the English ambassador,
concerning an exchange of prisoners.</p>

<p class='c000'>19. Sunday. This morning we found out that
one of our company, confederate with a black
man, had stolen, last night, an allowance of bread
and cheese from those who came last to prison,—for
which they made him run the gantlet up
one side of the prison and down the other, one
hundred and thirty feet, through a double file of
men armed each with a nettle.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>October</span> 20. There has been a prospect of a
French war ever since we have been taken, but
now I believe it is inevitable.</p>

<p class='c000'>21. To-day we have drawn new hammocks,
which are nearly a foot shorter than those we had
before, on account of the hanging of them being
altered.</p>

<p class='c000'>22. To-day the remainder of the prisoners came
on shore to the prison, and among them is a
young man belonging to one of the schooner
Hawk’s prizes. This young man formerly lived
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>with Thomas Tennant, of Newbury. From him I
obtained intelligence of the health of my father
and brother, and many other friends. It is a
great satisfaction to me to hear from home, though
it is very uncertain whether or not I ever see it.</p>

<p class='c000'>23. Wet weather.</p>

<p class='c000'>24. Warm and pleasant.</p>

<p class='c000'>25. King Charles’ restoration day. The garrison,
fort, and each ship in the harbor, in
commission, fired a salute. We are told that
twelve sail of the line have been put in commission
within a few days. We learn that there are
suspicions that a French fleet has gone to the West
Indies. To-day a large ship came in here in distress,
having carried away her main-mast and
mizen-topmast.</p>

<p class='c000'>26. It is eleven months to-day since we left
Portsmouth.</p>

<p class='c000'>27. Last night two prisoners, Cutter and Morris,
made their escape from the prison hospital;
also to-day another prisoner ran the gantlet for
stealing a penny loaf from one of the prisoners.</p>

<p class='c000'>28. We are informed that two sentries, who
were knowing to those two prisoners making their
escape, are confined upon suspicion, and one of
them has turned King’s evidence, and informed
of the other.</p>

<p class='c000'>29. Cold and windy weather.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>30. A bad storm, so that we keep house all day,
except when we get out to draw our provisions.</p>

<p class='c000'>31. Pleasant and warm, for the season.</p>

<p class='c000'>November 1. We are informed that a few days
ago, in a storm, a ship appeared, at a small distance
from land, and gave a signal of distress,
and in about ten hours was not to be seen; it is
supposed she foundered.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. We are informed that there is as hot a press
now going on as ever was known in England; and
that fifteen hundred seamen are wanted immediately,
to fit out a fleet.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. We have a paper, dated the 21st of last
month, wherein is an account of General Burgoyne’s
losing two thousand men, besides a number
taken prisoners.</p>

<p class='c000'>5. To-day is Gunpowder Treason, and they
make but little account of it compared with what
I expected. To-day a boy ran the gantlet, for
stealing.</p>

<p class='c000'>6. To-day some prisoners, in a separate prison,
who have been trying for some time to make
their escape by digging out, were discovered by
the guard.</p>

<p class='c000'>7. We have a paper wherein are several fine
pieces in behalf of America, which I hope will
prove of advantage, as the Parliament is to set
about the 15th or 20th of this month; I am persuaded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>that the American affairs will be called up
as the first question, and the subject of the most
importance.</p>

<p class='c000'>8. Two ships-of-war dropped down into the
Sound, in order for sailing.</p>

<p class='c000'>9. Sunday. Somewhat cold, and there are a
great many in prison who have neither shoes nor
stockings for their feet, and scarcely a jacket or
shirt for their back: these must inevitably suffer,
if not perish, this winter, with cold, if not
supplied with clothing. As to myself, I have
enough to keep me comfortable as to clothes,
which is more than two-thirds in prison have; for
many have been obliged to sell their clothes to buy
provisions.</p>

<p class='c000'>10. To-day six persons, in a separate prison, as
they were at work in a drain under ground, digging
out, were discovered by the guard, and
caught in the drain, and carried to the Black-hole.</p>

<p class='c000'>11. Two of the turnkeys, who used to tend the
doors and gates, have been discharged; I suppose
on suspicion of their being too good friends
to us.</p>

<p class='c000'>12. To-day an American captain, belonging to
Manchester, who was taken in a merchantman,
came to see us. He is set at liberty, and is bound
home. Several in prison sent letters by him, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>we could not write a true account, because our
letters were examined.</p>

<p class='c000'>13. Wet weather. Our yard, which was a
pleasant spot when we came into it, is now nearly
a mud pond in wet weather, and in dry a dust
heap.</p>

<p class='c000'>14. This morning, as some in prison were at
work, trying to dig out, the guard came in and
found the hole; and when they came to turn us
out, there were one or two who did not move so
soon as they wanted them to do, and they struck
and abused them; afterwards, when one of the
prisoners went to one of the prison windows to
look for something, the sentry in the prison yard
saw him and struck him over the back, and broke
his bayonet.</p>

<p class='c000'>15. It is twelve months to-day since we sailed
from Newburyport. I hope the Lord in whom we
ought to trust, will, in his own good time, deliver
us out of the hands of our enemies, and return us
to a free country,—which would be a day of good
fortune, a day of agreeable surprise and great joy.
Then would I say—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Thrice happy youth, though destitute and poor,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>These are my restoration days;</div>
      <div class='line'>The Lord, who brought me out, I’m sure</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Can teach me how his name to praise.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>16. Sunday. Pleasant for the season of the
year.</p>

<p class='c000'>17. This day I am twenty years of age. I have
often read in authors of some great transaction to
be laid open to the world in the year 1777, and I
have been looking for it, in hope of seeing the
event; but, alas! little did I think that at the age
of twenty years I should have spent almost a
twelvemonth of my time a prisoner.</p>

<p class='c000'>19. It has been reported for several days past,
that Philadelphia is taken. I believe I may assert
with truth, that since we have been taken, we have
heard fifty times that Philadelphia was taken, and
often I have seen it in the papers, and many people
believe it. It is in this manner that the poor
and common people in England are blinded, by
false reports; and some of the gentlemen of Plymouth
hired the sexton to ring the bells, for rejoicing.</p>

<p class='c000'>19. Captain Lee received a letter from Bilboa,
and had an offer of being supplied with money.
This letter informs us that Mr. Stevanson, Captain
Lee’s lieutenant, who made his escape from prison
on the 21st of September, has arrived safe in
Bilboa.</p>

<p class='c000'>20. This morning William Moody, a Newbury
man, taken with Captain Tileston about nine
months ago, came to see us. He has got invalided,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>and intends to make the best of his way
home.</p>

<p class='c000'>21. We are told that six more large ships have
been put in commission.</p>

<p class='c000'>22. Our bread to-day is intolerably bad; it appears
to us as though it was made of the grain of
malt, or chopped straw: there are straws in it an
inch long, and it is so hully and tough, that it is
scarcely fit for a beast to eat. We complained of
it, and were told if we would put up with it to-day
we should have no more such.</p>

<p class='c000'>23. Sunday. There are so many men in the
prison, and so few books, that, in general, we are
but poorly employed.</p>

<p class='c000'>24. We hear that there has a packet arrived
from America, but we shall not learn what news
she brings, until their contents have been to London
and refined.</p>

<p class='c000'>25. We hear that Captain Thompson, of the
Bailey frigate, is now in France.</p>

<p class='c000'>26. It is twelve months to-day since we sailed
from Portsmouth. It is enough to vex the spirit
of any man, to think that such a number of men
should be thrown away, and brought into trouble
through the misconduct of one man. If there
had been good conduct on board of our vessel, we
should have made up our cruise in twenty-four
hours from the time we were taken; for, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>same night, in a few hours after we were taken,
the Reasonable spoke twelve or fifteen sail of
transports bound to America, and their convoy had
thrown their guns overboard in a storm.</p>

<p class='c000'>27. We are informed that the King’s Speech is
in the papers, and that he is resolved to carry on
the war with America, at all hazards.</p>

<p class='c000'>28. For the two months past I have received ten
shillings for boxes. Ever since about ten days
after I came to prison, I have bought myself a
breakfast of bread and milk, every morning it was
to be had; and of late I have had potatoes to eat
with my meat almost every day, which, I am sorry
to say, is more than two thirds in prison can get.</p>

<p class='c000'>29. To-day I had an opportunity of reading the
King’s Speech to the House of Lords, on the 20th
of this month, in which he acknowledges that he
is much grieved at the great expense the nation is
at in this war; but he hopes that the Parliament
will assist him still in carrying it on with vigor.</p>

<p class='c000'>30. Sunday. Last evening, it being very dark
and stormy, we were in general resolved to put in
execution a plan proposed—to dig out at the
back side of the prison, seize the sentry, confine
him, and carry him out of call, but not to hurt
him. Upon breaking ground, they unexpectedly
saw a lamp placed near the hole, which gave light
all round, so that they thought it impracticable to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>put their design into execution. I think if it had
been otherwise, nearly two thirds in prison would
have gone out. I got myself dressed and ready,
and was in hopes of getting out, but to my sorrow,
I find myself still in Mill Prison.</p>

<p class='c000'>December 1. I had an opportunity of hearing
the paper read, which gives an account of General
Lee being exchanged; but for my own part, I do
not expect we shall be exchanged before the conclusion
of the war, unless France and Spain declare
war, which to appearance, cannot be avoided.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. We are informed that two packets have lately
arrived, and confirm the reports that Philadelphia
is taken. Also, they have reported that the Americans
have blown up an English seventy-four, which
was attempting to go up to Philadelphia.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. This morning the guard discovered another
hole which we begun to dig yesterday. I think
we have been very diligent and careful to improve
every opportunity to make our escape, but the
guard is so very strict with us, that I think it almost
impossible to succeed, and we have reason to
think that there are some traitors amongst us, who
give information of every thing of the kind which
we undertake.</p>

<p class='c000'>4. We, in our mess, bought another bag of patatoes,
for three shillings.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>5. This day twelvemonth I was at sea in a
storm; the same day, by what I can learn, was a
day of thanksgiving in America.</p>

<p class='c000'>6. Last evening, a man in prison received a letter
from a friend in London, which desired him
to make himself easy, for we should be delivered
before we were aware of it; but we have been told
such stories ever since we have been in England;
so we place very little confidence in it.</p>

<p class='c000'>7. Sunday. It is a great grievance to be shut
up in prison, and debarred from hearing the gospel
preached on the Lord’s day, though I did not
make much improvement of it when I had the opportunity.</p>

<p class='c000'>8. To-day we were all mustered, and after this
was over, the agent informed us that he had received
a letter from the Board, to put all in this
prison on half allowance, for breaking orders and
attempting to make our escape, until the transgressor
should be found out. But as we all, with
one voice joined in one cause, we thought it inhuman
to pitch upon any one man; therefore, by way
of contribution, we raised money enough to hire
one man to own the same and suffer for all, so that
we are obliged to support him while on half allowance
and make him amends for his sufferings.</p>

<p class='c000'>9. To-day the man delivered himself up, to go
to the Black-hole, and the agent allows him every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>indulgence consistent with his orders, which is a
very uncommon thing for him.</p>

<p class='c000'>10. Warm and pleasant, for the season of the year.</p>

<p class='c000'>11. There have been various reports for several
days past, but I thought them not worthy of observation,
because they did not come from so good
authority as I could wish they might; but to-day
we have a very authentic account from Captain
Henry Johnston’s brother, who is lately from London,
that General Burgoyne and his army are totally
routed, many killed, and taken to a man;
and as I do not doubt the truth of it, it gives me
more satisfaction than any news I have beard since
I have been a prisoner. Also, we have good reason
to believe that Howe is in possession of Philadelphia;
but Washington, of choice, without any
molestation, let him march in, for we hear that
the Americans have possession of all the forts on
the river.</p>

<p class='c000'>12. I purchased a book called the “American
Crisis,” on purpose to lend it to a friend without.
We are told that the generality of the people in
England are very much disaffected at the proceedings
of the ministry.</p>

<p class='c000'>13. To-day we all carried our clothing out into
the yard, and were examined to know who wanted
clothes, and who did not. But for my part, I am
not in need of any thing, for with what little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>money I have got in time past, by making boxes, I
have clothed myself tolerably well. We were told,
by a gentleman who came to see us, that our countrymen
at home have something to be proud of,
though we are a little humbled by our imprisonment.</p>

<p class='c000'>14. To-day Captain Lee received a letter from
Captain Trott, who was taken in one of the Civil
Usage’s prizes. He informs us of their taking ten
valuable prizes, and six of the number were arrived
safely at the place of destination.</p>

<p class='c000'>15. Cold weather to what it has been for some
days past.</p>

<p class='c000'>16, 17. We have a paper wherein is a confirmation
and the particulars of General Burgoyne’s
being taken, with six thousand men, seven thousand
stand of arms, seven thousand suits of clothes,
seventy thousand guineas, sixty batteaux, with a
thousand barrels of provisions, and a great many
pieces of artillery, which in England they acknowledge
to be the best ever sent out of the country,
against any nation. We have, also, a melancholy
account of the cruelty of the Indians in the
back settlements, set on by the inhuman Burgoyne,
and an account of General Lincoln’s taking
two forts, up North River, and putting the people
to the sword. We hear, besides, of General Washington’s
giving Howe battle, and after the battle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>was over, there were six hundred wagon loads of
dead and wounded seen to go into Philadelphia.
After hearing this news, joy is plainly seen in the
countenance of every American here.</p>

<p class='c000'>18. We hear that Lord North has made a motion
for peace, in the House, but they thought as
he was one of the chief instigators of war, that he
had no right to have any hand in making peace.</p>

<p class='c000'>19. We hear that General Putnam had intercepted
several letters sent by Howe to Burgoyne,
which showed their determination, and proved of
happy consequences to the Americans. According
to the last accounts, the American loss in
the late engagements is very inconsiderable.</p>

<p class='c000'>20. To-day six men came up from the Black-hole,
who were sent there on the tenth of last
month—their forty days having expired.</p>

<p class='c000'>21. Nothing remarkable, except repeated confirmations
of what we have heard before.</p>

<p class='c000'>22. We are informed that Parliament has adjourned
till the twentieth of next month; I
suppose, to hear further intelligence from Lord
Howe, and to know whether he has made any progress
in the country.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>December</span> 23. To-day we have new printed orders
put up in prison, which are from the commissioners,
to be strictly observed by us.</p>

<p class='c000'>24. It is twelve months since I was taken, and
as to-morrow is Christmas, and we have a little
money, we are resolved to have something more
than we had last Christmas; accordingly we sent
out for five pounds of flour, one pound of suet, one
pound of plums, half a pound of sugar, half an
ounce of spice, and two quarts of milk, to mix the
same for a pudding.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>25. Christmas. To-day had our intended pudding,
and as there was so much of it that we could
not conveniently boil it all in one bag, we made
two of it, and the largest was as much as seven of
us wanted to eat at one meal, with our other
provisions; these seven were of our own mess, and
three of our neighbors, whom we invited. To-day
our baker, who supplies us with bread, instead of
brown bread, sent us white, and our butcher, instead
of beef, gave us mutton, and instead of cabbage
we had turnips; and the butcher’s wife gave
us oatmeal to thicken our broth, and salt to salt
it; so that on the whole, we had not so hungry a
Christmas as the last. I must confess I have a very
agreeable expectation, if my life is spared and the
Lord pleases to permit me, to sit down at my
father’s table next Christmas.</p>

<p class='c000'>26. To-day considerable bread was given in the
yard, by gentlemen who visited us, besides a penny
loaf to each mess, sent in by our friends outside.</p>

<p class='c000'>27. For some days I have been unwell, and this
morning I took a portion of salts.</p>

<p class='c000'>28. Sunday. Warm weather, as it is natural in
this country and different from what it is in America,
at this season of the year.</p>

<p class='c000'>29. For a month past, I send out every few
days and buy half a pound of tobacco, and retail it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>out, so that I can afford to sell better measure than
can be bought at public market at the gate, and
thus oblige myself and my neighbors.</p>

<p class='c000'>30. To-day we had clothes served out to us, and
some who were almost naked received a jacket,
breeches, and two shirts, two pairs of stockings, a
pair of shoes, and a cap. I received only a pair of
shoes. Although I have been a prisoner more than
twelve months, I have received only a pair of shoes
from government; for we have reason to think
that the clothes and bedding which were served to
our company on board the Burford, were given us
by the captain of the ship.</p>

<p class='c000'>31. Those who did not receive clothes yesterday,
had them to-day, except shoes, which they
are to have in a few days; and those who petitioned
the Board to go on board His Majesty’s ships, received
an answer from the Lord of the Admiralty,
that all those who are legally committed to
prison could not be bailed. However, our long-wished-for
day draws near, for to-morrow the Act
will expire, by which we were committed to prison.
But we hear that it is likely to be renewed
again; God forbid it should be so.</p>

<p class='c000'>1778. January 1. I wish myself and all my
brother fellow-sufferers a very happy new year. I
do not know how to express my joy for so good a
beginning, but by hoping that it will end better.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>No sooner is this very impolitic Act out, than our
friends make themselves known to us, which before
they dared not do. To-day we had sent to
us a plum pudding, and a sixpenny white loaf, to
each mess, as a new year’s gift, which, with our
allowance, was sufficient for one day. Some gentlemen,
also, who are friends, came to see us, and
among the number was one Mr. Hancock, cousin
of John Hancock, president of the Continental
Congress. They inform us that upwards of £800
sterling have been raised in London for the relief
of the prisoners here, and that they are daily raising
more. They further told us, that we should not
want for any thing, so long as we are prisoners in
England. Transporting words! We have found
friends in adversity. “Friends in need, are friends
indeed.”</p>

<p class='c000'>2. To-day we received nothing but our usual
allowance.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. To-day we had sent to us a pound of soap to
each man!</p>

<p class='c000'>4. Sunday. We had sent to us a four pound
loaf, and about six ounces of shag tobacco, to each
mess, which we are told was given us by private
gentlemen.</p>

<p class='c000'>5. We had sent us a gallon of potatoes, to each
mess, and oatmeal to thicken our broth.</p>

<p class='c000'>6. To-day we had half a pint of peas instead of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>greens, to each mess; by order from the Board,
we are to have peas four times a week, which we
like very much. Again, also, we had a white loaf
sent us to each mess, and a small number of books.
To-day two boys, in prison, were tied up and
whipped, a dozen each, for making game of the
provision, because it was not cooked well.</p>

<p class='c000'>7. To-day one hundred and fifty blankets were
sent us, to be given to those who need them most;
and as there are two hundred and eighty-nine prisoners
here, there is not one to each man; so those
who have the best bedding receive none, and as I
have sufficient, I want none.</p>

<p class='c000'>8. We had a threepenny loaf to each mess,
sent us to-day, and as four of our number, who came
last to prison, have not had the small-pox, they
went to the hospital to be inoculated.</p>

<p class='c000'>9. This afternoon a number of gentlemen came,
and read a letter to us, which gives an account of
upwards of £200 sterling having been raised in
Bristol, for the relief of the prisoners here; also,
an account of £2,276 raised in London, for the
same purpose. In Portsmouth, we hear that there
are about one hundred and forty prisoners, so that
the number here and there, amounts to four hundred
and twenty-nine. What we have received
hitherto, has no connection with these donations,
but was given by private gentlemen.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>10. We had sent us a threepenny loaf to each
mess, and three hundred herring, to be divided
amongst us. Also, it being a pleasant day, the
prison was smoked with charcoal and brimstone,
as is customary once in a few days.</p>

<p class='c000'>11. We hear that Parliament is warned to meet
six days sooner than it adjourned for.</p>

<p class='c000'>12. To-day is the first that we have received
any thing from the donation raised for us, and
now we have a stated rule, which is a fourpenny
loaf each day, out of the money raised in Bristol,
except a few officers, who of choice, receive
the money instead of bread. We hear no more as
yet, of the money raised in London, but we suppose
it is not come down.</p>

<p class='c000'>13. We are told that ten recruiting parties are
gone out into the country, from the regiment
which guards us. Also, Captain Henry Johnston
received a letter from his brother in London,
wherein he desires him to make himself easy,
for we shall all be exchanged in the spring.</p>

<p class='c000'>14. To-day two ministers came to see us, and
informed us of many good things preparing for us,
which are too numerous to mention here; but if
we receive them, I shall give an account of them
hereafter.</p>

<p class='c000'>15. It is fourteen months to-day, since we sailed
from Newbury. Also, we had sent us to-day, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>yard of tobacco to each mess, and we are told that
we are to have a yard every other day, which is
four inches and a half to each man, per day.</p>

<p class='c000'>16. Those who did not receive shoes on the
30th or 31st of last month, received them to-day.
Also, we hear that all the wearing apparel that we
have received as yet, was given us by government,
but we are told that each of us is to have a great
coat and a suit of clothes out of the money raised
for us. Also, to-day we have another fourpenny
loaf to each mess, which makes eight pennyworth
of bread to each mess, per day, besides our allowance
by government. We are advised by all our
friends without, to make ourselves contented for a
little while, for they tell us that they have all the
reason in the world to believe that we shall be out
of prison in three months. We had sent us a
number of printed exhortations, urging us to lead
a civil, sober life, and to leave off swearing and
profaning the name of the Lord, for that is the last
thing that many do before they sleep, and the first
after they awake.</p>

<p class='c000'>17. To-day we had clothes served out to us, out
of the money raised for us; such as two shirts,
two pairs of stockings, a pair of shoes, jacket and
breeches, to those who needed them, and caps.
The officers received white linen shirts instead of
check, and hats instead of caps. They tell us we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>are all to have great coats in a few days; the
clothes have not all come, so we are not all served.
I was served to-day. I received two shirts, two
pairs of stockings, a pair of shoes, a jacket and cap.
We had also, a pound of pork to each mess, to
eat with our peas; and we are told that we are to
have it every Saturday. We had tobacco served
again, and are told it is to be continued.</p>

<p class='c000'>18. Sunday. We have an addition of about
half a pound of beef to each mess.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lord Cornwallis arrived yesterday in the Sound,
from America. We hear that Howe has taken all
the forts which command the Delaware.</p>

<p class='c000'>19. Last night there was a heavy thunder-squall,
and if I mistake not, there has been but
one thunder-shower since I have been in England.
Yesterday was the Queen’s birth-day, but on account
of its being Sunday they did not fire; but
to-day each ship in commission, the fort and garrison,
fired twenty-one guns as a royal salute.</p>

<p class='c000'>20. To-day they have again been serving clothes,
but have not finished.</p>

<p class='c000'>21. The remainder in prison had clothes served
to them, so that each man in prison has received
a great coat, and a suit, or nearly a suit, of clothes,
out of the donation fund. We have, also, had our
broth thickened, and it is to be continued; besides
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>a pound of beef to each mess more than our allowance
by government.</p>

<p class='c000'>22. We have now got into a settled rule of receiving
our donation. The officers, such as captains
and lieutenants, are allowed five shillings
a week; sailing masters and prize masters, four
shillings a week; boatswains, carpenters, and such
like, three shillings per week, and privateers-men,
two shillings per week, which is laid out in such
provisions as we think proper. What we receive
in provisions, besides the government allowance,
is as follows: one pound and a quarter of bread to
each mess, and a quarter of a pound of beef per
day, except Saturday; we then receive a quarter of
a pound of pork. We have thickening and leeks in
our broth; tobacco we receive every other day;
soap we receive as we want it; but the officers,
what they do not receive in provisions receive
in money. We have now every thing that we
want as to provisions and clothing; but there is
one thing yet lacking—a thankful heart.</p>

<p class='c000'>23. As keeping ourselves clean is conducive to
health, the agent has indulged us, for a few days
past, with liberty for six of us per day, to go down
into a separate yard to wash, where there is a
pump and convenience for washing.</p>

<p class='c000'>24. I have heard little or no news, for this week
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>past, and indeed no news is the best news for us;
for if there is any thing against us, they are ready
enough to tell us.</p>

<p class='c000'>25. Sunday. Cold, blustering, unsteady weather.</p>

<p class='c000'>26. It is fourteen months to-day, since we sailed
from Portsmouth. To-day I went down into the
hospital yard to see one of my sick acquaintances,
who is down with the small-pox, under an excuse
to go to wash.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>January</span> 27. We are informed by the man who
contracts for our tobacco, that it is very scarce,
and hard to be got for the money; it is three shillings
and sixpence per pound, which is one shilling
and twopence dearer than it was at Christmas.
The officers, in a separate prison, are allowed to
burn candles in the evening until gun-fire, which
is eight o’clock.</p>

<p class='c000'>23. To-day some new washing troughs were
brought to prison for us to wash our clothes in,
and now we have plenty of clothes, soap, water
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>and tubs to wash in. In general, we are tolerably
clean.</p>

<p class='c000'>29. It being a pleasant day, the prison was again
smoked. Concerning being released, we have no
reason to think that those gentlemen who gave us
encouragement intend to flatter us, as often the
darkest hour of the night is just before day. It
may be so with, us, as those things which we have
received since new year, came entirely unexpected
to us; who knows but our redemption may
come as suddenly and unexpectedly; so that I
think it becomes us to put things on a medium,
and make the best of a bad bargain; not to let our
fears exceed our hopes, nor to put so much dependence
on getting out, as to be disappointed of
it; but as we are committed to prison by a civil
magistrate for high treason, it is the opinion of
some, that it is not in the power of the King or
council to release us without some sort of a trial.</p>

<p class='c000'>30. Yesterday afternoon, about sixty pairs of
blankets were sent for those who had none. We
also have the paper, wherein is an extract of a letter
from a nobleman in the British service in
America. He writes, that Cornwallis embarked
on such a day, for home, to lay before the King
and council the true state of America; he writes
that the Americans want for nothing that is
necessary, while they are in want of every thing.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>Beef is four shillings per pound in Philadelphia,
and other fresh provisions in proportion; and flour
is not to be had. He states that it is wholly owing
to Howe’s good conduct that they are not totally
cut off to a man, but if the Schuylkill freezes over,
it is not too late to do it yet. We also have a paper,
wherein is Lord North’s proposition for reconciliation
with America.</p>

<p class='c000'>February 1. Sunday. Last evening, between
seven and nine o’clock, five of the officers in a
separate prison, who had agreed with the sentry
to let them go, made their escape and took two
sentries with them. The five officers were Captain
Henry Johnston, Captain Eleazer Johnston,
Offin Boardman, Samuel Treadwell and one Mr.
Deal. Captain Henry Johnston having several
suits of good clothes, he gave each sentry one,
which they put on, and left their regimentals at
their posts, with their firelocks, and made off; they
were soon discovered by the guard, and pursued,
but not taken.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. I had a quantity of cedar brought to me to
make boxes of.</p>

<p class='c000'>4. This afternoon a fleet of about twelve or fifteen
sail, with a convoy, arrived in the Sound, and
saluted the admiral. It is thought they are part
of Burgoyne’s fleet, as we have heard that they
were expected home.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>5. To-day two large ships went from the Sound
up to Ammoors, one of which had lost her main-top-mast.
We are told that the three parties that
went in pursuit of those who made their escape a
few evenings ago, returned unsuccessful.</p>

<p class='c000'>6. For two or three days I have been out of
wood, so that I have done very little work, but to-day
I had enough brought to last me a month.</p>

<p class='c000'>7. To-day we had half a pound of pork more than
usual, to each mess, which makes a pound and a
half to each mess.</p>

<p class='c000'>8. Sunday. We have the paper wherein is an
extract of a letter from Dr. Franklin, Dean and
Lee, to Lord North, and to the ministry, putting
them in mind of the abuse which the prisoners
have received from time to time, and giving them
to know that it is in the power of the Americans
to make ample retaliation, but they hoped
that there was more humanity left in their hearts.
They also wrote concerning an exchange of
prisoners, and that if they would not exchange,
they hoped that Congress would be permitted
to appoint an agent to supply the prisoners in
England with such things as were necessary, at
their own expense. We learn that their answer
was, that in America there was an exchange.</p>

<p class='c000'>11. For some days past, the masons have been
at work building a chimney.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>12. We have a paper wherein is an account of
the House of Parliament being very full, and that
there is upwards of two hundred and fifty for carrying
on the war, and upwards of one hundred and
fifty for settling it. I am glad to find that the minority
increases fast; the same paper informs us
that there is nearly one half against the method
they take in raising money to carry on the war,
and there is a disturbance about the method they
take for raising troops. The same paper also informs
us, that their troops at home are five
thousand six hundred and seventy-three short of
the peace establishment, and that there is only
about ten thousand troops in England, Ireland,
Scotland, Gibraltar and Mahon.</p>

<p class='c000'>13. Many people in England, besides us prisoners,
thought that Burgoyne’s troops were to be
sent home, as we have heard, agreeably to their
capitulation, but by this time we are persuaded to
the contrary.</p>

<p class='c000'>14. For two or three days I have been out
of wood, so that I have done but little work; till
within a few days I have received three shillings
for boxes.</p>

<p class='c000'>15. To-day it is fifteen months since we sailed
from Newbury.</p>

<p class='c000'>16. To-day it snowed about three hours, just so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>as to cover the ground. It is the first time the
ground has been covered this winter.</p>

<p class='c000'>17. Clear and cold. It is now we find the benefit
of our great coats. We hear that the two soldiers
that deserted and went off with the before-mentioned
officers, from the prison, have been taken;
which I am sorry to hear, for they will undoubtedly
both be shot; and not only so, but I am
afraid that their being taken will be followed with
other bad consequences.</p>

<p class='c000'>18. The chimney, in a separate prison, is so far
completed, that we have a fire in it. To-day about
twelve o’clock, the Governor of Plymouth and his
lady, came to see us, and bought some of our
wooden ware, and tasted of our broth; he said it
was very fine, as indeed it has been, ever since we
have had it thickened, and leeks put into it.</p>

<p class='c000'>19. We are told by almost every one that comes
to the gate, that a French war is near at hand,
and cannot be avoided.</p>

<p class='c000'>20. To-day each man in prison had a check linen
handkerchief sent to him, which was given us
by the donation. Also, to-day the officers in this
prison moved into another, which has been preparing
for them, so that all the officers who were
committed to prison, as such, are in a prison by
themselves.</p>

<p class='c000'>21. Some time ago we had two fourpenny loaves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>to each mess, per day, but one of them was soon
taken off; and as they told us we should have as
much provision as we wanted, we made it known
to them, that we were desirous of having a sixpenny
loaf instead of the fourpenny one, which they
granted, and to-day we received a sixpenny loaf to
each mess.</p>

<p class='c000'>22. Sunday. We hear that General Gates sent a
letter to one of the Parliament, in which he deplores
the state of Great Britain, and advises them
to make peace, before the Americans form alliance
with any other nation. But he states that they
will accept of nothing short of independence.</p>

<p class='c000'>23. We have been informed several times, lately,
that all the Acts since the year 1763, are likely
to be repealed. “Peace with America and war
with France,” is the cry of almost every Briton.
We have a paper in prison wherein is Lord
North’s speech in the House. He confesses that
the English troops in America, have been beaten
by inferior numbers. For several evenings past,
we have had candles burning in prison, unknown
to the agent, turnkey or guard; but I expect it
will not be long before we shall be allowed to burn
them, as we have written to the Board concerning
it. We hear that a proclamation is issued for
public fast throughout England, Ireland and Scotland.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>25. We hear that commissioners are appointed
to go to America to treat with Congress; and they
are to be considered a legal body while in treaty
with them.</p>

<p class='c000'>26. Last night the snow fell about two inches
deep, on a level, which is more than it has snowed,
put it all together, during the winter.</p>

<p class='c000'>27. This day is kept as a public fast, throughout
the united kingdom. I suppose they did not
think it worth while to proclaim a fast before, as I
do not remember that there has been one since
I have been a prisoner, except a yearly fast. It is
the opinion of many in prison, that if the proposals
have not already gone to America, that we shall
be sent with them, to give an assurance that they
are real.</p>

<p class='c000'>28. We are credibly informed that America has
formed an alliance with France, for the space of
twenty-one years; but whether it is any thing
more than an alliance for trade, we have not yet
learned. We hear that it took place the 26th of
this month. We also hear that the money raised
in England for the Americans here, amounted to
£7000 sterling.</p>

<p class='c000'>March 1. Wet, dirty weather, which obliges us
to keep house most of the time. To-day is the
first day of spring, and I have some secret expectations
of being liberated before the season is expired,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>as there is a fleet of transports, with provision,
bound to America, which will be ready to
sail by the last of this month, or the first of April.
Some think it probable that we may be sent with
them.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. Warm and pleasant for the season. We received
an answer to the petition we wrote for the
liberty to burn candles in the evening, but the answer
was that we could not be allowed the privilege.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. We have a paper in prison, from which we
learn that Congress has made a present of a gold
medal to General Gates, and a sword to the commander
at Mud Island, for their bravery. There
is also a slur upon Howe, in the paper, which is,
that he has got three miles in length, and two in
breadth, in the late campaign.</p>

<p class='c000'>4. To-day, every man’s clothing was examined
to see if we keep ourselves clean. Last evening
one of the prisoners was sent to the Black-hole,
for abusive words spoken to the agent, and
another to-day, for selling his clothes, which were
given him, to get money to gamble with.</p>

<p class='c000'>5. Remarkably pleasant weather for the season.
It is so warm, and the yard is so dry, that we all
carried our hammocks and bedding out to air.
Yesterday, Captain Lee received a letter, by the
way of Bilboa, from Newbury, from Mr. Tracy,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>by which we learn that he is daily striving for our
exchange.</p>

<p class='c000'>6. Although we are not allowed lights in prison,
yet we have them every evening, and intend
to till we are found out; and then they can do no
more than deny us of them, for when we cannot
get candles, we burn marrow-bones, which give a
very good light, and a good bone will last as long
as half a candle.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>March</span> 7. We are told that the two soldiers
who deserted and carried five of the officers from
prison, on the evening of the 31st of January,
have had their trial. One of them is condemned
to be shot, the other to receive seven hundred
stripes. After their trial some handbills were
sent to the barrack, to the dock, and to Plymouth,
to set forth the heinousness of their crime in deserting
their colors and carrying off rebels with
them; but the people in the King’s dock-yard,
and some sailors who were on shore from the men-of-war,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>gathered in a mob; got all the bills together
that they could find, and burnt them.</p>

<p class='c000'>8. Sunday. We hear that there has been several
commissioners chosen to go to America, but
they all refuse to go.</p>

<p class='c000'>9. For the week past I have been something
poorly, but the prisoners in general are remarkably
healthy; never did I hear of such a number
of men confined together who enjoyed such perfect
health, and had so little sickness as we have.
Even upon short allowance we enjoyed our health,
though every man pined away to merely skin and
bone. Those who had no money to help themselves,
and looked pale and ghastly, and were so
weak as scarcely to be able to walk, now look
brisk, lively, and we all are strong, fat, and
hearty.</p>

<p class='c000'>10. We are informed that about three hundred
merchants in London, Bristol and other places,
have petitioned for peace with America, otherwise
they will be entirely ruined. We hear that a
great part of the merchants in Bristol are broken,
and worth nothing.</p>

<p class='c000'>11. We learn that some recruiting parties that
went into Cornwall to obtain recruits, met with a
very severe reception; the people gathered together
and disarmed them, and drove them out of
their territory. Indeed, all England seems to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>in commotion: it is the opinion of some, that
should the American war continue another year,
there would be civil war in England; it seems to
be but little short of it now.</p>

<p class='c000'>12. We are informed that General Howe has
written home for a reinforcement immediately, or
he must inevitably share the fate of Burgoyne;
this inspires us with fresh courage. To-day our
two fathers came to see us, as they commonly do
once or twice a week. They are Mr. Heath and
Mr. Sorry, the former is a Presbyterian minister,
in Dock; the latter a merchant in Plymouth.
These are the two agents appointed by the committee
in London to supply us with necessaries.
A smile from them seems like a smile from a
father; they tell us that every thing goes on well
on our side, so that I hope our long wished for
prize is just at hand—a prize that is preferable
to any other earthly enjoyment. I hope our days
of trouble are nearly at an end, and after we have
borne them with a spirit of manly fortitude, we
shall be returned to a free country to enjoy our
just rights and privileges, for which we have been
so long contending. This will make ample satisfaction
for all our sufferings. To-day we received
two shillings per mess, which is sixpence per man;
this is back money that we had not received, as
we receive two shillings per man a week; what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>we do not receive in provisions we have in money.</p>

<p class='c000'>13. Three Marblehead men came to see us,
who were lately taken in a merchantman bound to
France. They are about two months from America.
They had the liberty to talk with us for
nearly an hour. To-day three men were brought
to prison, they being officers of a privateer that
was taken and carried to the West Indies. They
inform us that provisions are so scarce in the
English islands that the inhabitants move from
one island to another on that account, and are
almost starved; they also inform us that Mr. Samuel
Treadwell is taken, and is now on board the
Blenheim; he is one of the five who went out on
the 31st of June.</p>

<p class='c000'>14. To-day Mr. Treadwell was brought back to
prison and put immediately in the Black-hole,
where he is to lay forty days on half allowance.
This afternoon, for the misbehavior of three or
four persons, we were all confined in prison; and
it being a very pleasant afternoon, it aggravated
many so that they ran fore and aft the prison
screaming, and some cried murder, which alarmed
the guard, and we were turned out, and the
offenders delivered up and sent to the Black-hole,
where they must lay until orders come from the
Board to take them out.</p>

<p class='c000'>15. Sunday. For some days past I have spent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>most of my time in reading, and I can better compose
myself to it now than I could six months ago.</p>

<p class='c000'>16. We are informed that on Saturday an
American privateer chased a merchantman into
the mouth of this harbor, and then hoisted her
colors and made the best of her way from land;
and that a frigate, that lay in the Sound, slipped
her cable and went after her.</p>

<p class='c000'>17. St. Patrick’s Day. By what we can learn,
a French and Spanish war is very near at hand.
The French are making all preparation for the
contest, so also are the English, for we are told
that all the ships belonging to the navy, that with
repairing will be fit for sea, are to be put in
commission immediately; and such a hot press as
there is now in England was never known—they
press against all protections.</p>

<p class='c000'>18. To-day another was sent to the Black-hole,
for selling the clothes which were given to him;
which is no more than right. We are informed
that we are to be removed very soon and carried
to Chester castle, but we pay no regard to it; for
I believe two-thirds in prison expect to be sent to
America within three months.</p>

<p class='c000'>19. We hear again that we are to be carried to
Chester, but pay no regard to it, as I said before.</p>

<p class='c000'>20. We are informed that last night two or three
hundred men were pressed in Plymouth, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>Dock; even the lamp-lighter who tends the
lamps about the prison, was pressed; but as he
was in the King’s service he was released. A
lieutenant of one of the King’s ships came to
prison and advised those who had a mind to go on
board the men-of-war to petition immediately. Accordingly
a petition was written and signed by six
old countrymen, and sent to the commissioners.</p>

<p class='c000'>21. Dull, thick weather, some rain, so that we
keep house.</p>

<p class='c000'>22. Sunday. Some time ago we heard that
some troops were to be sent to America this
spring, but to-day we hear that their orders are
countermanded.</p>

<p class='c000'>23. To-day four or five large ships sailed from
the Sound, bound to Spithead to join a fleet. We
were found out to-day in conveying bread to the
half allowance men in the Black-hole; so there is
now a stop put to it.</p>

<p class='c000'>24. Pleasant, for the season of the year. We
received a letter from two of the officers that made
their escape from prison on the 31st of January
last; they inform us that they were taken up in
London, and are now on board a guard ship in
Portsmouth, waiting to come round.</p>

<p class='c000'>25. We were informed that a few days ago a
large ship accidentally ran down a French brig
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>in the Sound; eleven men were drowned, and her
mainmast carried away.</p>

<p class='c000'>26. Last evening the guards discovered our
lights in the prison, so that I am afraid there will
be a stop put to it.</p>

<p class='c000'>27. There are many in prison who have sold
all their clothes that were given them by subscription,
to get a little money to gamble with, and buy
strong beer; some of these have been found out,
and justice is likely to be done them.</p>

<p class='c000'>28. We hear that an American Captain, who has
long been confined in prison, in London, petitioned
for a trial, and was cleared and set at liberty. He
then sued them for false imprisonment, but he was
immediately apprehended and sent to Newgate.
He again petitioned for a trial, was again tried,
acquitted, and set at liberty, and went off.</p>

<p class='c000'>29. Sunday. Stormy, so that we keep house,
except when we go to draw our provisions.</p>

<p class='c000'>30. We are informed that tobacco is 5s. a
pound; at Christmas it was only 2s. 4d.</p>

<p class='c000'>31. To-day I received the books which myself
and another sent out to buy. These are the
“Preceptor,” in two volumes; the price of them
was twelve shillings. The reason of its being so
long after we sent out for them before we received
them, was, they could not be bought in Plymouth,
and the bookseller had to send to London for them.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>April 1. To-day the two soldiers who went off
with five officers, on the evening of the 31st of
January last, received their punishment; one was
shot, the other whipped; they belonged to the
Light Infantry in the regiment.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. Warm, and something pleasant, and the yard
begins to be dry again, so that we can return to
our former sports; these are ball and quoits, which
exercise we make use of to circulate our blood
and keep us from things that are worse.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. This afternoon the agent and his clerk, the
steward and doctor, seated themselves opposite the
prison door and called over the roll, and ordered
us one by one to pass out, and we were examined
to see if we had our full compliment of clothing
that was given us, and that they were clean and in
order.</p>

<p class='c000'>4. To-day each of us again received sixpence,
which was back money, as before mentioned. Also,
three of his Majesty’s ships sailed—the
Queen, of ninety guns, the Ocean, of ninety guns,
both three-deckers, and the Fieutryant, a two-decker
of eighty-four guns, which was taken from
the French, the last war; we are told that she is
the longest ship in the navy.</p>

<p class='c000'>5. Sunday. It is ten months to-day since I
came to prison. One Sunday passes away after
another, seemingly disregarded by us, to our shame.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>6. We keep house to-day on account of it being
wet weather, and the prison yard is very muddy.</p>

<p class='c000'>7. Mr. Heath, one of our fathers, has been in London,
for near a month, and Mr. Sorry is to set out
in a few days. To-day the latter came to see us,
and we desired him, for the future, to send us a
fourpenny white loaf to each mess, per day, in
place of a sixpenny one, for we have more provisions
than many of us want to eat; and any person
can easily conjecture that prisoners in our situation,
who have suffered so much for the want of
provisions, would abhor such an act as to waste
what we have suffered so much the want of.</p>

<p class='c000'>8. We are informed that the English ambassador
has returned from France, and upon his return
he informed His Majesty that the King of France
had recognized the independence of America.</p>

<p class='c000'>9. Very warm and pleasant, so that all the prisoners
in this prison carried their bedding out into
the yard to air, and the prison was smoked with
charcoal and sulphur, as is customary every few
days. To-day we received a fourpenny loaf according
to our request.</p>

<p class='c000'>10. To-day Captain Boardman and Mr. Deal
were brought back to prison, which makes three
of the number brought back who went out on the
31st of January last. The other two were Captain
Henry Johnston, of the Lexington, and Captain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>Eleazer Johnston, of the Dolton. These, we
suppose, have got clear. Also, this afternoon
William Titcomb, a Newbury man, came to see
us, about half an hour, and very glad was I to see
him. He was taken in the Yankee Hero, by the
Milford. He informs us that he has belonged
to the Milford ever since he was taken, and he has
been present at the capture of four American privateers.
Upon their passage home, they took a
vessel, which was one of the Civil Usage’s prizes.
The Milford arrived about three weeks ago. Titcomb
has been unwell, and has been in the royal
hospital most of the time since he arrived. He
told us that he had rather be in our situation than
his.</p>

<p class='c000'>11. Very warm and pleasant; it is as warm as
it was any time last summer. The spring is very
forward, much more so than the last; but we were
told that last spring was uncommonly backward.</p>

<p class='c000'>12. Sunday. It is twelve months to-day since
I set my foot upon this island, but now I think the
auspicious day is about to dawn, when, if it is the
Lord’s will, we shall bid it farewell. To-day, by
an order from the Board, we drew cabbage instead
of broth, and we are to have cabbage two days in
a week, peas two, and broth three, which we like
much better; for when a person is confined to one
steady diet, and has enough, he soon gets tired of it.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>13. We are informed by Captain Boardman,
that while he was out, he saw one Mr. Bapson,
lately from America, who belonged to Cape Ann.
He informed him that a new ship of twenty-six
guns, which was built by the Marine Society of
Newbury, Captain William Friend, master, just
after she got over the Bar, filled and sunk, and a
number of men were drowned. He also informs
us that Captain James Tracy in the new ship Hero,
has not been heard of since he sailed; and
that the schooner Washington has been absent
some months, and they are afraid she is lost. William
Titcomb, who was here a few days ago, told
us that Tracy, in company with another frigate,
was cruising off the Cape of Good Hope.</p>

<p class='c000'>14. We are informed that Governor Johnston
and two others, have kissed His Majesty’s hand,
and are appointed commissioners to go to America.</p>

<p class='c000'>15. What money I have received for boxes since
I have been in prison, amounts to over three guineas.
Had it not been for this money, I must inevitably
have suffered more than I did.</p>

<p class='c000'>16. Very warm and pleasant; the grass and
herbs in the fields appear to us as forward, from
what we can see from the prison, as they do the
first of June in America.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>April</span> 17. To-day one of the prisoners received
a letter from Captain Harris, of Portsmouth. He
writes that we may rely upon it, that he had it
from good authority, that the vessels were taken
up, and were under repairs, to carry us home; and
according to his letter, he expects to be on his
passage in a month’s time. There are many in
prison who gather some encouragement from this.</p>

<p class='c000'>18. According to the best accounts, there has
been a great debate in the House of Commons.—The
Duke of Richmond is for giving the Commissioners
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>full power, before they return, even to declare
the States independent, if nothing short will
answer; Mr. Fox and Mr. Burke are of the same
mind. But Lord Chatham declares that he had
rather be in his grave than see the day that America
is declared to be independent. According to
their own account, this American war has cost
Great Britain, £30,000,000, and thirty thousand of
their best disciplined troops—eleven thousand
eight hundred the last campaign.</p>

<p class='c000'>19. We are informed that a packet has lately
arrived from America, but as yet we know not
what news she has brought.</p>

<p class='c000'>20. We have a paper in which is an account of
twenty-eight sail of vessels, laden with English
goods, laying in some port of England, bound to
America.</p>

<p class='c000'>21. We have accounts in the paper of the Boston
frigate, and another frigate out of Boston, having
taken a number of valuable prizes.</p>

<p class='c000'>22. There was one man came from the Black-hole,
his time being up. There are four more
left therein, but we find means to help them, as we
have others before them; we having a plenty of
provisions, can help them, and not injure ourselves.
To-day I went out to buy a small pocket Bible,
the price of which was three shillings and sixpence.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>24. Three more came out of the Black-hole;
there is but one left, and he will be out in a few
days.</p>

<p class='c000'>25. Captain Lee received a letter from Captain
Trott, a prisoner in Bristol. He wrote that those
of us who have a mind to write to America, can
do so, by immediately sending the letters to him.
He will send them to France by a man bound
there. Several, therefore, wrote, and sent them to
him. He also informed us, that by his own desire,
he is going to London to receive his trial,
which put us in mind of petitioning for a trial, also.
Accordingly, a petition was drawn up, and
about one half in prison signed it. The contents
of the petition were as follows:</p>

<p class='c000'>“To the King’s Most Excellent Majesty: the
petition of sundry of the subjects of the United
States of America, showeth, that your petitioners
were at several respective periods, in the year of
our Lord 1777, committed to Old Mill Prison, in
the County of Devonshire, for the suspected crime
of high treason; your petitioners are unable to be
exactly positive as to the particular style or wording
of the crime represented, in whole or either
of their commitments, but as their bodily health is
at present much impaired, and they fear it will be
more so, so that their lives may be endangered by
a longer confinement in prison, they humbly request
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>that your Majesty will be pleased to order
them to be brought to trial with all possible speed,
for the crime or crimes of which they may be supposed
guilty. And your petitioners,” &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c000'>26. For some months past we have thought it
presumption to try to make our escape from prison
by digging out, on account of there being traitors
amongst us. An innocent man has borne the
scandal of this a good while, but upon being told
of it by a friend, he took no rest day or night until
he had found the traitors, and upon examination
we discovered them to be two negroes, a man and
a boy. Accordingly, they were tied up and
whipped—the boy was whipped by a boy, two
dozen and a half lashes, on his bare back; and we
thought it the man’s prerogative who had borne the
blame of being a traitor and was innocent, to lay
the stripes upon the negro man. Accordingly, he
gave him three dozen upon his bare back, and
spared not; had the negro stayed till night he
would have left his ears; but I suppose that he
was suspicious of that, so he went and jumped
over the gate and delivered himself up to the guard
and told his story. The negro boy was sent for
so now they are both separated from us in another
yard, and it is well for them that they are so.</p>

<p class='c000'>27. A man came out of the Black-hole, his time
being up, and Mr. Boardman and Deal, who have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>been only seventeen days on half allowance in the
prison hospital, were sent into this yard. They
are the only persons who have broke out and been
taken, who have not suffered forty days on half allowance
in the Black-hole.</p>

<p class='c000'>28. Last evening being somewhat dark, two
young men had a mind to try to make their escape;
one of whom cut his hammock and blanket
into strips and tied them together; got over the
wall at the end of the prison into the yard, and
was there caught and sent to the Black-hole. Today
all the negroes were taken out of this prison,
and put into a separate building, called the itchy
yard.</p>

<p class='c000'>29. To-day is Wednesday, which is our pay day,
and each man received sixpence; and as we have
received it regularly for some weeks past, we are
told that we are to have it weekly; so in future, I
shall only mention when we do not have it.</p>

<p class='c000'>30. There is a number sick now, more than has
been since we came to prison, except in time of
small-pox. There are three or four in the prison
hospital who are very sick with fever, and several
more in this prison who are very ill. For a few
weeks past, the agent has indulged us with the
liberty of pens, ink and paper, so that we have an
opportunity for writing and cyphering.</p>

<p class='c000'>May 1. To-day the Tarbay, a ship of seventy-four
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>guns, as she lay at her moorings, accidentally
took fire, and we are told that her upper works
are burned to a coal, and being old, she is not
worth repairing; she has been but a few days out
of dock.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. We have a newspaper, from which we learn
that an American privateer, commanded by Captain
John Paul Jones, from Portsmouth, went into
Whitehaven, sent her boat on shore, and spiked
up the cannon, and set fire to a ship, and had it
not been for a man that deserted the boat and
alarmed the town, the boat’s crew would have set
fire to all the shipping in the harbor. They then set
off and went to Scotland, where they went on shore
and plundered Lord Selkirk’s house of £5000 worth
of plate, and took several cattle. To-day a large
ship arrived in the Sound, which we took to be an
East Indiaman, but have since heard that she is a
transport from New York.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. Sunday. To-day we received two letters
from the prisoners in Portsmouth. They inform
us that there are one hundred and eighty prisoners
there. They also inform us that Captain Weeks,
in a privateer of sixteen guns, bound from France
to America, foundered upon the Banks of Newfoundland,
and all were lost but one.</p>

<p class='c000'>4. To-day, Captain Lee, taken in a merchantman
belonging to Manchester, came to see us. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>informed us of Captain Tracy’s arrival, and that
he had taken an East Indiaman; but we do not
hear of any homeward bound East Indiamen missing.</p>

<p class='c000'>5. To-day several of us had an opportunity of
writing letters to send by Captain Lee, who came
to see us yesterday, as he is bound directly home.</p>

<p class='c000'>6. This morning about eight o’clock, Mr. John
Fowler, a prisoner, died in the prison hospital,
with a pleurisy fever. He was only a few days
sick, and in the afternoon there was a jury over
him. They will not tell us the occasion of a jury’s
being called, but it appears that the public
were jealous that there had been bad usage. This
man is the fourth that has died since I came to
prison. He is the first of Captain Lee’s men that
has died since they were imprisoned.</p>

<p class='c000'>7. To-day there have been several men drunk in
prison, as there often is when they can get money
to buy beer; and there has been a wrangle between
the old countrymen and the Americans.
The Americans unanimously hang together, and
endeavor to keep peace in prison, but if the former
party were stronger than the latter, we should have
a hell upon earth.</p>

<p class='c000'>8. This afternoon there were three prisoners
brought to prison, who were taken in a prize upon
the Grand Bank, bound to America, by a large old
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>East Indiaman, which has been made a transport.
She was bound from New York to England, with
a few of Burgoyne’s officers on board, wounded
and exchanged. The three who came to prison
tell us that they had the offer of entering the English
service, yet they chose to come to prison.
The prize-master’s mate entered the service; of
those who came to prison, there was one Newbury
man, one Casco Bay man, and one Philadelphia
man.</p>

<p class='c000'>9. To-day three large two deckers dropped
down into the Sound, from Ammoors, bound to
Spithead, to join the fleet that is bound to sea, for
the purpose of watching the motions of the French.</p>

<p class='c000'>10. The commissioners sailed from Portsmouth
in the Trydant man-of-war, of sixty-four guns,
bound for America, April 22d.</p>

<p class='c000'>11. We have a hole now in hand, and as we
have not convenient places in prison to conceal all
the dirt, for many days past many of us have been
employed in the smuggling way, by carrying it out
in our pockets and under our great coats, and emptying
it into the vaults; but this afternoon we met
with a misfortune, for a hole which we had been
digging for ten days past, by times, foundered.</p>

<p class='c000'>12. This morning after we were turned out, we
so contrived it that the officer should enter into
conversation with the turnkey and sentry on guard,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>and draw their attention, and in the meantime we
stopped the hole, so that it was not discovered.</p>

<p class='c000'>13. We are resolved to be in the way of our
duty, by embracing every opportunity to make our
escape.</p>

<p class='c000'>14. To-day about one o’clock, another prisoner
died in the prison hospital. It is thought that he
died of consumption. His name was Joseph Kensington;
he was taken in the Lexington privateer,
with Captain Henry Johnson. He is the fifth
man that has died since we came to prison. If a
man is ever so sick in prison, he has nothing allowed
him by the doctor that is nourishing, but
a little barley-water and milk broth; but we have
reason to think that all necessary things are allowed
by government, but it is left to the doctor’s option;
so the sick do not have them at all.</p>

<p class='c000'>15. It is eighteen months to-day since we sailed
from Newbury, but I hope in a few months to be
exchanged; and I expect that matters will be settled
amicably, for it is the opinion of many people
that come to the gate to see us, and of a great part
in prison, that the commissioners are invested
with full power to settle the difficulties before they
return, upon the best terms; even to declare the
States independent, if necessary.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>May</span> 16. We are informed that a French privateer
was taken by a Guernsey privateer, a few days
ago, and brought in here. She had eighty men on
board, a number of whom were officers bound
to America. We are informed that she had
a commission to sink, burn and destroy all
that she met belonging to Great Britain. We have
also a newspaper, by which we learn that a French
fleet, consisting of twelve sail of the line, and six
frigates, sailed from Toulon on the 13th of April,
and passed through the Straits of Gibraltar on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>24th, commanded by Count D’Estaing, supposed
to be bound to America.</p>

<p class='c000'>17. Sunday. We are informed by the paper,
that on the 10th of this month, William Pitt died.
I think that all England has reason to mourn the
loss of so great a man, at this critical juncture,
and the house of Bourbon to rejoice.</p>

<p class='c000'>18. Mr. Sorrey, one of our “fathers,” has returned
from London. He informs us that General
Burgoyne had arrived in London before he left,
but whether he is exchanged, or come home on
parole, we have not yet learned. Mr. Sorrey tells
us that we must exercise a little more patience.
We cannot, however, gather much patience in the
yard, it is rather inclined to nettles.</p>

<p class='c000'>19. We hear that General Burgoyne came home
on parole of honor, and is to return as soon as he
has dispatched his business.</p>

<p class='c000'>20. To-day Mr. Walch, one of the lieutenants
of the Lexington, about two o’clock in the afternoon,
had an invitation from a sentry that stood
without the wall at one corner of the yard, to go out.
Accordingly he dressed himself, and went as directed.
At night, when the guard came to turn
them into the prison, it was so contrived that a
small boy should go in first, and then slip out of a
window and be counted in twice; so that they had
their number and did not miss him.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>21. This morning when they were turned out
they did the same, and by that means it was not
found out. This contrivance was to screen the
guard that was on duty, when he went out, fearing
lest if it was found out, they would mistrust which
way he escaped, and thus the sentry be exposed.</p>

<p class='c000'>22. Last night, the second time the guard went
into the officers’ ward, they found that one of them
was missing; but it was about thirty hours after
he went away, before they had the least suspicion
of it. This morning, after we were turned out,
we were mustered to see if there were any more
gone, and while they were mustering us, one of
the prisoners, with red hair, said something to the
officer that he did not like, for which he threatened
to put him in the Black-hole. After muster,
accordingly, they made search for him, but could
not find him, as they had no other mark for him
but his hair. They then sent us into prison, and
took aside each one that had red hair, but they
could not find him among the number, so they let
the matter pass. This afternoon, another man got
over the wall at the corner of the yard, by the
vault, and, by his own folly, was taken and sent to
the Black-hole. On account of this futile attempt,
we were sent into the prison in the midst of a
pleasant afternoon; and as they were turning us
in, there was one man a little obstinate, who would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>not voluntarily go in; they therefore took him
to the Black-hole also.</p>

<p class='c000'>23. This forenoon, as some of the prisoners were
playing at ball in the prison yard, the ball happened
to lodge in a spout that is placed under the
eves of the prison to convey the water, when it
rains, into the well in the yard. They sent a boy up
after it, and one of the sentries without the wall
saw him, levelled his gun at him and fired, but the
ball happened not to touch him. To-day Admiral
Biron and his fleet arrived in Plymouth Sound,
from Spithead. The fleet consists of thirteen sail
of the line, and one frigate. They are bound to
America, in search of the French fleet that sailed
from Toulon.</p>

<p class='c000'>24. Sunday. For two days past, the guard has
been so strict with us that they have placed a sentry
at the gate, and do not allow a prisoner to go
near it upon any occasion whatever; and this afternoon
after we were turned into prison, one of
the prisoners got up to a window to look out, and
a sentry without, saw him and bade him get
down; as he did not get down as soon as asked,
he fired at him, but did not hurt him. We think
the occasion of the guard’s being so strict with us
lately, is the conduct of a few evil-minded men in
prison, who, as regularly as they receive their sixpence
per week, lay it out at the gate for strong beer—drink
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>it all at once, and so get drunk. Then
they abuse any one who comes across them.</p>

<p class='c000'>25. We hear that the King has granted all the
men in the fleet, that now lay in the Sound, eight
days to frolic and make themselves merry.</p>

<p class='c000'>26. To-day a poor American widow came to
see us; she is daughter to Dr. Murray, in Newtown
Chester, Maryland. She told us that she was
lately from America, that her husband is dead, and
she is left with three small children in a strange
land, and with nothing to help herself. I do not
know what business she had here, but as there
were some who knew her in America, and as she
seemed to be an object of charity, we contributed
among us about a guinea, and gave it to her.</p>

<p class='c000'>27. This morning, very early, the guard came in
and surprised some of us, while we had a piece of
the wall down, and were digging. Some one
must go to the Black-hole for it, but as yet there
is nothing done about it.</p>

<p class='c000'>28. We hear that night before last, all the Fishermen
in the harbor were pressed out of their
fishing boats, on board of the fleet which now lays
in the Sound.</p>

<p class='c000'>29. To-day is what they call Royal Oak, or King
Charles’ restoration day, and each ship, fort, and
garrison, fires a salute.</p>

<p class='c000'>30. To-day another hole was begun.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>31. This forenoon we were all turned out into
the yard, but a few who stayed in to dig; and
while they were at work, the guard happened to
come in to drive a prisoner down from an end
window; so they went directly up stairs, which
gave those who were at work an opportunity of
making off into the yard. But the guard, before
they went out, found out the hole, and the agent
declared that he would have four men go to the
Black-hole, or the whole should be put on half
allowance. He gave us until four o’clock in the
afternoon to consider of it, and at the time four
men delivered themselves up of their own
accord, to go to the Black-hole, rather than that
all should suffer. But as we are all equally concerned
in every such scheme, satisfaction will be
made to them by us.</p>

<p class='c000'>This afternoon, one Captain Pulford, came to
see us. He is only about forty days from North
Carolina, and was taken in a merchantman bound
to France. He informed us that General Lee has
been exchanged.</p>

<p class='c000'>June 1. Two gentlemen who came to see us to-day,
informed us that the French Admiral, now
laying in Brest with thirty-six sail of the line, besides
frigates, sent a challenge to the English Admiral
to meet him off Brest. We are also informed
that there are orders from London for a larger
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>prison, three stories high, separate, and in another
yard, to be repaired for the reception of the French
prisoners.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. In expectation of some making their escape,
a difficult piece of work was undertaken, which I
hope we shall prosper in.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. Ever since I have been in prison there have
been vaults dug in the yard, for the prison offal,
until within a fortnight. The vaults having since
then been full, each man has taken his turn to
empty the tubs, twice a day, into the river. This
morning two in the Black-hole went to empty
their tubs at the river’s edge, about twenty-rods
distant, and having a mind to try to make their escape,
although part of the guard was with them,
they left their tubs and ran. They were immediately
pursued by the guard, and overtaken about a
quarter of a mile distant; and after they were secured,
they used them shamefully, knocking them
down two or three times, and very badly injuring
them. As our cook, who prepares our victuals,
gave chase and caught one of them, we determined
that he should suffer for it. This same cook has
lately got a license to sell strong beer, and his wife
tends daily at the gate, and there are many in
prison who have bought of her a great deal. But
we are unanimously agreed to buy no more of him.
A man who has been only two days out of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>Black-hole, was carried there again to-day, for
abusing the sentry in the yard.</p>

<p class='c000'>4. To-day is the King’s birth-day, and each ship,
fort, and garrison, fired twenty-one guns as a royal
salute. I think that his subjects would have more
reason to rejoice at his death than at his birth-day;
for according to the best accounts, the national
debt is more than one hundred and forty-six millions.
A commissioner has been here to-day, reviewing
the prisons; I suppose to give orders in
what manner they shall be repaired for the accommodation
of the French. There are two of
our ship’s company that have been very ill for some
months past, and as the doctor will not let them
have things necessary for their comfort, we think
it our duty to contribute to their relief, as Providence
has put something in our hands. Accordingly,
to-day we raised among us a trifle of money
to buy them such things as they want, and we
shall raise more as they need it. This afternoon,
there were thirteen prisoners brought to prison
from the Blenheim. They were lately brought
from Liverpool, and have been taken nearly five
months; they were captured in a privateer, fitted
out of Salem, The captain’s name is Ravel. Today
a fleet of fishermen, consisting of about thirty
sail, went out of the Sound, bound to Newfoundland.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>5. The fleet that sailed yesterday for Newfoundland,
meeting with contrary winds, and the weather
looking likely for a storm, put about and came
in again. It is twelve months to-day since I came
to prison. I believe four months ago it was the
opinion, of every one within these walls, that we
should be out before this day, but I believe now,
most of us despair of being exchanged this summer,
unless General Burgoyne’s coming home
should be of advantage to us. He is able to represent
the case as it is, for we hear that the Congress
told him, before he left America, to go home
and take his seat in Parliament, and speak the
truth, for the truth could not hurt them.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>June</span> 7. Sunday. This morning we are informed
that our chief doctor is dead. He died
very suddenly; I believe there are not many in
prison who will mourn, as we have no reason to expect
that we can get a worse one. This forenoon,
after we were turned out, two men of this prison
got into a drain at one corner of the yard,
and were digging, when one of the turnkeys
present found out that they were at work, and
alarmed the guard. They were taken and carried
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>to the Black-hole, but we shall find means to help
them, as we have done others before. The hole
in which they were at work was commenced five
days ago. They had nearly finished the work before
it was found out. Thus every method we take
to make our escape is found out before it is accomplished,
and our unhappy efforts are not blest.</p>

<p class='c000'>8. We hear that the fleet of men-of-war, now
lying in the Sound, have received orders for sailing;
also, that the convoy of the Newfoundland
fleet, while they were out, took a sloop from North
Carolina, loaded with indigo, bound to France.</p>

<p class='c000'>9. This morning the fleet sailed, under the
command of Admiral Biron; it consists of eleven
sail of the line, and two frigates. They are bound
in search of the French fleet, commanded by
Count de Estaing, which sailed from Toulon,
bound to America. To-day Captain Dennis, from
Cape Ann, came to see us; he was taken in a
brig out of Newbury. He informs us that Captain
Tracy is wholly given over, which I am very
sorry to hear. Captain Dennis has got his clearance,
and is bound directly home, and will carry
letters for those who desire to send. This afternoon
thirteen more prisoners came to prison from
the ships; they belonged to the same privateer
with those who came last Thursday. For my
own part, I think it very poor encouragement for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>us to see the number of prisoners increase; I
think it looks very melancholy within these walls,
and more and more so every day. I am so uneasy
that I cannot content myself to do any thing;
let me seem to be ever so busy, my mind is not
fixed upon what I am about. It is dwelling upon
my situation and condition.</p>

<p class='c000'>10. To-day several of us wrote letters to send
to America by Captain Dennis, but he has not yet
come after them. When Mr. Sorrey came to
bring us our money, he told us that orders were
come for us to be exchanged for the prisoners in
France. We put more confidence in what he
says, because he has been very cautious hitherto
of telling us news. To-day the whole prison has
been in an uproar, occasioned by one or two
drunken fellows, who, as regularly as they get any
money, get drunk with the beer which is
bought at the gate. One of these was so outrageous
that he drew his knife, and walked fore
and aft the prison, striking and abusing those he
met. When we were turned out in the afternoon
we complained to the agent, and he, by a desire
of most of the men in prison, was sent to the
Black-hole. After we delivered him up, he, out
of spite, told of a window where some one in
prison had sawed off a bar.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>11. The commissioner has again been in the
yard to talk with us.</p>

<p class='c000'>12. To-day the fleet of Newfoundland fishermen
sailed again, and I am afraid Captain Dennis
has gone and left our letters.</p>

<p class='c000'>13. There are now several masons and carpenters
at work on an old three story prison, in another
yard, repairing it for the reception of
French prisoners. The man who was delivered
up to the agent, a few days ago, is put in irons.
He is the only one that has been put in irons since
we came to prison.</p>

<p class='c000'>14. The Rev. Mr. Heath has returned home from
London, having been gone nearly three months;
and yesterday afternoon he came to see us. He
tells us that he has been informed that many of
us pay no regard for the Sabbath, which is too
true; for it is equally the same with many in this
prison, whether it be the Sabbath or any other
day. They will run about the yard, and play, and
curse, and swear, and blaspheme, the greater part
of the time. Many of them are the most wicked
and profane men that I ever saw or heard of; but
there are a great number of steady men. Mr.
Heath gave us a few books, and he says that he
has a number more to give to such as will make
good use of them.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>15. We hear that the reconciliation bill, which
was sent to America from England, last February,
met with a very cool reception, both by the American
and Howe’s troops, and was even treated with
the greatest indignation by both. General Howe,
we hear, is expected home soon, and General
Clinton is to take the command at Philadelphia.
We hear that there is now a Spanish fleet of twenty-one
sail of the line riding at anchor in Cadez,
ready for sea. We have also heard it reported of
late, that the American army is so destitute of
clothing that they are obliged to strip the women
of their petticoats to cover them. These things
are put in the papers to amuse the public; but
we know better; it is inconsistent with reason,
and utterly false.</p>

<p class='c000'>16. To-day we received a letter from one Captain
Harris in Portsmouth prison; he writes to us
that there are two hundred and fifty prisoners in
France, and that we may depend upon it, that he
had it from good authority, that we are to be exchanged
for them, as far as they will go. But in
this prison we are very faithless; we have been
flattered too long for our profit. I heard some
days ago that there were six hundred prisoners in
France. There are now in these prisons three
hundred and sixteen American prisoners.</p>

<p class='c000'>17. We hear that Parliament is prorogued until
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>the middle of July. I suppose by that time they
expect to hear from the commissioners.</p>

<p class='c000'>18. Yesterday, after we were turned out and
the doors shut, three small boys entered through
the grates into the prison and damaged several
hammocks, for which, this morning, their ship’s
company tied them up and whipped them. Today
four men came out of the Black-hole, who
went in on the 31st of May; they have been in
only eighteen days; the reason of their not tarrying
longer is, a commissioner being here from
London, they petitioned him for pardon, and he
granted it. There are only three left in the
Black-hole now.</p>

<p class='c000'>19. I hear, privately, that the soldiers have orders
not to fire on the prisoners if they see any
making their escape; to fire only clear powder to
alarm the guard; and they are not to strike any
of us, nor offer a bayonet to us: thus their rigor
has been abated since Burgoyne has been taken.</p>

<p class='c000'>20. This forenoon, Rev. Mr. Heath came and
delivered us a letter, which we found to be from
a gentleman who is one of the committee of appropriation
for the money raised by subscription for
the relief of American prisoners in this country.
He desired that we should send him the name, former
residence, and occupation, of all the prisoners;
he assures us that there is a prospect of an exchange
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>for some, if not all of us; he also desired
that we should keep good order, and by no means
attempt to elope. I lack words to express my
gratitude to these gentlemen; for had it not been
for our numerous friends, doubtless many of us
had now been in our graves.</p>

<p class='c000'>21. Sunday. Notwithstanding our friend’s advice,
we have a plan in agitation for making our
escape, and are resolved to go on with it. Our
design is to get into a drain at the corner of the
yard, where the last hole was found out, and dig
up on the other side of the wall. For this purpose,
yesterday afternoon three men took down a
piece of wall under a window, in an old prison
adjoining this drain. These men got into the
prison and the wall was put up again, and plastered
up with dirt. They dug into the drain and
tarried there all night and till after we were let
out in the morning, when we let them out. Last
night, when we were counted into prison, three
boys went in first and got out at the window, and
were counted twice, to make up the number.</p>

<p class='c000'>22. Last night and to-day this scheme was carried
on as before. This afternoon Captain Dennis
and Captain Talford came and took our letters.
They have got their clearance and are bound directly
to France. I sent a letter by Captain D.
to my father. Captain Dennis’ hands consisted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>of nine Beverly men; they are all kept on board
the men-of-war, as they have served all others during
the war taken in merchantmen, except the
captains, and them they clear.</p>

<p class='c000'>23. Last night the scheme was carried on the
same as before, till about 8 o’clock in the evening,
when they were discovered by the guard and sent
to the Black-hole; after which they went into the
officers’ prison, where were Captain Bunten and
Captain Boardman walking; they were ordered
to bed, and they refused to go, for which they carried
them to the Black-hole. This afternoon one
of the prisoners was sent down to the prison hospital;
he had been so sick and weak for some days
past, that when we were turned out into the yard,
and the door locked, (they having driven him out,)
as he could not walk, we were obliged to lead
him. When out, he could not stand, but was
forced to lay down on the ground; and when
down, could not rise up without help.</p>

<p class='c000'>24. Last night, there were two more carried to
the Black-hole from the officers’ prison, for not being
in bed when the guard came in, which was
between nine and ten o’clock. The officers in
prison have drawn up a petition to send to the
board, to know if Mr. Coudry, the prison keeper
has orders to confine any one for not being in
hammock at nine or ten o’clock in the evening.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>25. According to the newspapers, General
Burgoyne gives the American troops a brave
name; he says that the troops he had at his command
were as good as double the number of any
other troops the King has, and that the American
troops were as good as his, and would fight as
well.</p>

<p class='c000'>26. Yesterday afternoon, while the guard was
turning us into prison, four that were in the
Black-hole, and one that was in the hospital, broke
out through the drain, and got a boat a quarter of
a mile off, but they were soon discovered, and
pursued by the guard. The militia were raised,
and they were all taken in about half an hour and
brought back. This afternoon, those five, with
all the rest, were sent up into this yard. Those
who came to prison last had clothes given them,
which were allowed by government. I received
a pair of breeches, as I had not received any before
since I came to prison. This morning a
French cutter was brought in here, taken by an
English cutter; and at the same time two French
frigates were taken, which, I hear, have arrived in
Portsmouth. Six of the wounded Frenchmen
were brought from the cutter to prison, and put
in the hospital.</p>

<p class='c000'>27. This afternoon two of the officers in prison
had an invitation by a sentry to go over the wall,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>which they did, but were discovered, taken, and
sent to the Black-hole.</p>

<p class='c000'>28. We hear that the Arathusa frigate was dismasted
in the engagement with the two French
frigates above mentioned.</p>

<p class='c000'>29. Joseph Barnum, one of our company, who
has been unwell ever since he had the small-pox,
more than twelve months ago, has now got the
white swelling in his knee, which the doctor thinks
will occasion his death, if not cut off; and he is so
weak that I fear he is not able to undergo the
operation.</p>

<p class='c000'>30. For a long time we have been imposed upon
by the agent and butcher, by sending us bad
meat. Yesterday there were maggots found in
our beef, and we told the two butchers who go into
the cook-room to inspect our meat—that if it
was the same to-day as yesterday, not to cut it up.
Accordingly, they went out this morning, and as
the meat proved to be very poor, our butchers refused
to cut it up. Upon this, the agent ordered
the cook to cut it up, which he did, and cooked it.
At twelve o’clock the meat was brought in, in a tub;
but we had all agreed not to take any of it. The
agent told us if we would accept of it to-day, as
it was cooked, we should have no more like it,
but have better in future. He has, however, told
us these stories too often, and we thought if we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>took it to-day, we should have the same another
day; therefore we positively refused it; for we
can live as well upon the fat that we have gathered
from the donation, two days, as we could seven
months ago upon all our allowance.</p>

<p class='c000'>July 1. Last night six men in this prison attempted
to make their escape; they got out at a
window into the yard, but as they were trying to
get over the wall, they were discovered by a sentry,
so they returned and got in at the window
where they got out.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. To-day forty-seven more French prisoners
were brought to prison, but they were all foremast
hands; for all the French officers are allowed to
go on parole. To-day the New Duke, a ship of
ninety guns, dropped down in the Sound, in order
for sailing. She is a new ship, and has been
launched since I came to prison.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. As it is two years to-morrow since the
Declaration of Independence in America, we are
resolved, although we are prisoners, to bear it in
remembrance: and for that end, several of us
have employed ourselves to-day in making cockades.
They were drawn on a piece of paper, cut
in the form of a half-moon, with the thirteen
stripes, a Union, and thirteen stars, painted out,
and upon the top is printed in large capital letters,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>“Independence,” and at the bottom “Liberty or
Death,” or some appeal to Heaven.</p>

<p class='c000'>4. This morning when we were let out, we all
hoisted the American flag upon our hats, except
about five or six, who did not choose to wear
them. The agent, seeing us all with those papers
on our hats, asked for one to look at, which was
sent him, and it happened to be one which had
“Independence” written upon the top, and at the
bottom, “Liberty or Death.” He, not knowing the
meaning of it, and thinking we were going to force
the guard, directly ordered a double sentry at the
gate. Nothing happened till one o’clock; we
then drew up in thirteen divisions, and each division
gave three cheers, till it came to the last,
when we all cheered together, all of which was
conducted with the greatest regularity. We kept
our colors hoisted till sunset, and then took them
down.</p>

<p class='c000'>5. The carpenters and masons have been at
work for some days past, repairing an old prison
in the yard.</p>

<p class='c000'>8. This afternoon, Rev. Mr. Heath came to see
us, and gave us several books; he informs us that
General Howe has arrived home, and that the
King’s troops have left Philadelphia.</p>

<p class='c000'>9. We are told that Captain Dennis and Captain
Talford, with five or six other American captains,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>bought a small vessel to carry them to France, and
yesterday morning set sail.</p>

<p class='c000'>10. To-day Joseph Barnum, one of our company,
and one of the French prisoners that was
wounded, had their thighs cut off. Barnum has
been unwell more than a year; he has had a white
swelling in his knee.</p>

<p class='c000'>11. We have a hole now in hand, which we
thought this afternoon was found out, but it happened
to be one within a few feet of it, which was
discovered some time ago, and was of no great
consequence.</p>

<p class='c000'>12. Sunday. To-day Captain Lee received a
letter from Portsmouth prison, from Jonn Dame,
a Newbury man. He informs us that he was
taken with Captain Dennis in a new privateer brig,
of sixteen guns, that sailed from Boston on the
25th of May. On the 30th of the same month he
was taken by the same frigate that General Howe
came home in.</p>

<p class='c000'>13. Since the Frenchmen came to prison we
have been of considerable help to them, as we
have now plenty of provisions, and many of us
more than we want to eat. What we have to
spare we give to them, and we daily give them
more or less. Their allowance of bread is six
pounds to four of them per day, which is one and
a half pounds per man; but we rebels are allowed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>only one pound of bread a man, per day, from
government. The other allowances of the French
is the same as ours.</p>

<p class='c000'>14. Admiral Keppel has lately sailed from St.
Helena with about twenty-eight sail of the line
and six frigates; and a French fleet has sailed from
Brest; but I cannot learn the exact number of
ships of which the fleet consists. It is expected,
whenever these two fleets meet, there will be a
bloody engagement, for England’s chief dependence
is in her fleet.</p>

<p class='c000'>15. It is twenty months to-day since I left Newbury.
To-day Admiral Keppel’s fleet was seen
from the prison to pass by this harbor, and it is
expected that two or three ships from this port
will join them. This afternoon four boys tried to
make their escape; they got over the wall into
the Frenchmen’s yard, and hid in their hammocks,
but were soon discovered, and taken.</p>

<p class='c000'>16. We hear that Parliament is prorogued until
some time in September next. To-day the Sudbury,
a ship of seventy-four guns, sailed to join
Admiral Keppel’s fleet, which now appears off
this port. The guard now consists partly of the
Cornish, partly of the Somersetshire, and partly
of the Devonshire militia, and some of the thirteenth
regiment, which is the regiment that has
guarded us ever since we came to prison.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>July</span> 17. There are a number of very quarrelsome,
lawless men in prison, who have been the
occasion of a great deal of mutiny and disturbance
amongst us, which has obtained for us the ill-will
of our friends; and we have been informed that
unless there is an alteration among us, our donations
will be stopped; so that we thought it proper
to have Articles among ourselves. These were
drawn up to-day; they forbid all gambling, and
blackguarding, which have caused great disturbance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>in the yard, and occasioned much fighting.
They also forbid any improper language to any officer
or soldier, who are now, or may hereafter be,
appointed to preside over us. These articles were
read in the yard before all the prisoners, and then
stuck up in prison, and two men out of each ship’s
company were appointed to see them put into execution.</p>

<p class='c000'>18. We hear that Count D’Estaing’s fleet has arrived
in Boston. I learn, also, by the papers, that
twenty-five sail of the line are now laying at single
anchor in Cadiz, ready for sea. Their place of
destination is not known.</p>

<p class='c000'>19. Sunday. As there have been many books
given in lately, the prison is much stiller of Sunday
than formerly, and the people are much better
employed. This forenoon, as some were in a drain
digging, they were heard by the guard, but they
got out before the guard reached the hole.</p>

<p class='c000'>20. Wet, rainy weather, so that we kept house
most of the day. There has been little or no rain,
for two months, until last night and to-day. The
ground has been so parched for want of rain, that
the fields look like the fall of the year.</p>

<p class='c000'>21. Last night about nine o’clock, it being very
dark and rainy, we opened a hole at the back side
of the prison, large enough for two men to go out
abreast. This hole has been ready for some time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>past—they have only been waiting for a dark,
stormy night; when they broke ground, the pavement
fell in, and four men jumped out and got off.
A sentry within ten feet of the hole, saw them,
and immediately alarmed the guard; so that no
more could escape. The guard came in, and
while they were in prison the guard-house chimney
took fire; upon which the drum beat to arms, and
fire was cried. The cry was that the prisons were
on fire, and the prisoners were breaking out. After
this was over, the guard came in again and took
nine of the prisoners and put them in the Black-hole,
because they were up and had their clothes
on. To-day, about one o’clock, four of the officers
from the officers’ prison got over the wall into the
hospital yard; two of whom got out, but were soon
discovered and taken. The other two were taken
in the yard, and all put into the Black-hole last
night, but came out to-day.</p>

<p class='c000'>22. Yesterday noon, another hole was begun in
this prison, and at night when we were turned in
again, they went to work until nine or ten o’clock;
but were then discovered by the guard, who immediately
came in and carried two to the Black-hole.
In the afternoon, they took two boys at work in
the drain before mentioned; and to-day two of
those who went out night before last, were brought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>back, and another came back of his own accord.</p>

<p class='c000'>23. Most of this day the prison has been in an
uproar, occasioned by a few men that will not be
conformable to the rules and articles that we
have amongst ourselves, but threaten to take them
down and destroy them.</p>

<p class='c000'>24. This morning we found that our articles
were abused, and we took three of the before-mentioned
men and tied them up to a post in the
prison, and poured cold water down their arms
and neck, for the space of half an hour. One of
the three was afterwards complained of to the agent,
who ordered him to be put in irons, and separated
from us.</p>

<p class='c000'>This afternoon, six more Frenchmen we
brought to prison.</p>

<p class='c000'>25. Yesterday a ship of seventy-four guns, and
a frigate, arrived in the Sound, from Admiral Biron’s
fleet, with two hundred and forty-six sick
men on board. The occasion of this ship’s coming
home was that she had sprung a leak, and the
frigate came with her for fear that she might founder
at sea.</p>

<p class='c000'>26. Sunday. I daily expect to hear of an engagement
between the English and French fleets
as we have heard several accounts of their being
seen in sight of each other.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>27. Cool weather for some days past, which is
much better for us, as so many of us are confined
together.</p>

<p class='c000'>28. This afternoon we received two letters from
Portsmouth prison—one from John Dame, the
other from Benjamin Tappan. They give us a
very disagreeable account of thirty-nine young
men belonging to Newbury, who were lost with
Capt. Tracy. Many of their names were mentioned
in the latter; some of them I was intimately acquainted
with. I could rather wish them in prison
with us, than entirely lost.</p>

<p class='c000'>29. This morning a large three-decker dropped
down into the Sound, in order for sailing. Also,
we have the London Evening Post, which informs
us of the Lively, twenty gun ship, and a frigate,
being taken. The last paper before this gives an
account of two cutters being taken. They were
captured by the French and carried to France.</p>

<p class='c000'>30. Yesterday was pay-day, and there are a
number of men who make it a practice to get
drunk every opportunity, and two men last night,
who were in liquor, struck and abused two Frenchmen,
who were taken in the American service,
and the majority of those in prison who were
Americans, took their part, and complained to the
officer of the guard. The offenders were sent to
the Black-hole, and this morning we took the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>Frenchmen up stairs with us, where they will not
be abused any more.</p>

<p class='c000'>31. Yesterday, some in this prison had an invitation
by a sentry to go over the wall, but as it was
in the day time, they thought it not proper; but at
twelve o’clock at night, the same sentry came to
the same place and gave a signal, upon which seven
men went out at a window where one of the iron
bars were loosened, ready to be pulled out. After
these seven men got out, the sentry alarmed the
guard, and four of the number were soon taken. If
they had waited a few moments longer, we should
have had a hole in the back side of the prison, for
a number more to have got out. The guard
tell us that they have orders to fire at any one they
see getting over the wall, and also, that the soldier
who let these men go is now under confinement,
and will be either whipped or shot.</p>

<p class='c000'>This forenoon, Admiral Keppel’s fleet arrived
in the Sound. The greatest part of this fleet now
lay where we can see them from this prison. We
hear that they have had an engagement with the
French fleet, but have not learned the particulars.
To-day, also, a dozen more Frenchmen were
brought to prison. Six came out of the Black-hole;
among whom was Captain Lee. While he
was there, he received a letter from General Burgoyne.
There are six remaining there still.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>August 1. All that I can say to-day concerning
the fleet, is, that several of the ships are very much
shattered. Two or three are now lying on their
beam-ends, in the Sound, and the boats have been
passing and re-passing from them ever since they
came in. We have seen a vast number of men
come from the ships, in boats, whom we suppose to
be wounded, as we are informed that there are between
seven and eight hundred wounded men in
the royal hospital, who were taken out of the fleet.
This is the fleet which they have been raising for
the two years past, concerning which they have
boasted so much, and which they have called the
terror of France. This was England’s pride—the
fleet that was to sweep the seas, and accomplish
such wonders. Alas! many of them are disappointed
of their expectations, for in their first engagement
they were worsted.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. A man in prison received a letter from his
brother, who is in the fleet. He informed him that
he was in the engagement, and there was only
twelve sail of the English fleet that engaged the
French fleet; but I suppose that he was not allowed
to write the particulars.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. For these two months past, since we have
been allowed pens, ink and paper, I have employed
them to as much advantage as possible. Most of
the time, I have busied myself in writing and cyphering.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>I have had as much writing to do as I
could accomplish; and to-day I sent out to buy
books and instruments to learn navigation. To-day
a number more Frenchmen were brought to
prison.</p>

<p class='c000'>4. To-day one of the two shattered ships that lay
in the Sound warped up, went to Ammoors, and
the other lays opposite to our prison. To-day I
began to study navigation.</p>

<p class='c000'>5. A gentleman, who came to see us to-day,
gave in half a guinea, to be drank by the prisoners;
but we thought it better to divide it among
the sick of the respective crews.</p>

<p class='c000'>6. The masons and carpenters have been at
work repairing an old prison in the yard; and this
afternoon, as one of the laborers was at work, he
pulled off his coat and hung it up against the prison,
in the yard, and left the basket, that he had to
bring slate in, with it. One of the prisoners
went and put on the coat, and put the basket over
his head, and went to the gate; and the turnkey,
thinking it to be the laborer, let him out. As he
was walking through the street, the laborer met
him, knew his coat, and ran and alarmed the
guard, who went in pursuit of him and soon took
him.</p>

<p class='c000'>7. We have been waiting impatiently to hear
from the commissioners, for some time past, hoping
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>that they would settle affairs; but we have had a
flying report for some weeks, that they are likely
to return as they went, without doing any thing.
When they first sailed, it was the opinion of many
in prison, that they were invested with full power
to settle it; but soon after, we were convinced to the
contrary.</p>

<p class='c000'>8. From the Exeter paper we learn that there
was only twenty-five sail of the line of battle-ships
that engaged the French fleet, and that they had
but five hundred and six men killed and wounded;
but the royal hospital, where the wounded are, is
but a small-arms’ shot from this prison, and we
have been repeatedly and credibly informed by
those who reside in the neighborhood, that there
is upwards of a thousand wounded men in the hospital,
and a cart is seen to carry away the dead
every day. The engagement took place on the
27th of July.</p>

<p class='c000'>9. Sunday. Last evening, as four men went to
empty their tubs, two of them took to the water to
swim away, but were soon taken up. The commissioner
who was here a few weeks ago, came
again to-day, to regulate affairs.</p>

<p class='c000'>10. This afternoon the guard came in and
turned us all out, and locked the doors, which
aggravated many, who wanted to be in prison—some
reading, some writing, some cyphering, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>some studying navigation. Some went and picked
the locks, opened the doors, and went in; upon
this the guard came in again, and turned us all
out and placed a sentry at the prison doors. Two
men, out of spite, went to fighting, and it took most
of the guard to separate them. Soon after, another
fight happened, and about the same time the commissioner
came into the yard, and ordered one of
them to be sent to the Black-hole. In all this disturbance,
the officers of the guard appeared very
mild and calm; they are officers in the militia.
Most of those that have been on guard since we
have been guarded by the militia, have behaved
very well towards us, and very much like gentlemen,
as they are chiefly gentlemen of fortune. To-day
the other three men were brought back that
made their escape from prison on the 30th of July,
in the evening.</p>

<p class='c000'>11. Those who were brought back yesterday,
were sent up out of the Black-hole to-day. They
tell us that they would not go out again if the
gates were set open; for they said it is a thing impossible,
to get off the island. While they were
out, they saw a number of ships belonging to Admiral
Keppel’s fleet, which lay where we cannot
see them from the prison, that were very much
shattered and disabled in the engagement.</p>

<p class='c000'>12. To-day we were all examined, as of late has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>been customary once a month, to see who need
clothes, and who do not.</p>

<p class='c000'>13. Those who wanted shoes, were served to-day.
These are allowed by government.</p>

<p class='c000'>14. This morning, three French prizes were
brought into this port—a ship, a brig, and a
sloop.</p>

<p class='c000'>15. This forenoon some officers from the
ships, who were sent by Admiral Keppel, came
here to take a list of the names of those who have a
mind to go on board the men-of-war, and thirty in
number gave in their names. Among the number
were some Americans, but they were chiefly
old countrymen. The officers brought with them
an American who was taken with Captain Martingale
in the first of the disturbance. His officers
gave him a guinea to treat his countrymen.</p>

<p class='c000'>16. Sunday. To-day another officer came from
the ships. He, also, came for men.</p>

<p class='c000'>17. We hear that Admiral Keppel and his fleet,
are to sail in a few days.</p>

<p class='c000'>18. This afternoon there were five Americans
brought to prison. They were all taken in different
vessels. Some of them belonged to armed
ships, others to merchantmen. Some of them
have been taken this six months, and have been
hurried about from ship to ship, and used scandalously.
They had a bounty offered them to go on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>board this fleet, now lying in the Sound, but they,
like brave Americans, refused, and chose rather
to come to prison. They were sent here without
being examined, or committed by any justice of
the peace.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>August</span> 19. This afternoon an officer from the
ships came for those five men who were brought
here yesterday. When they found out that they
were to be carried on board the ships, as they were
advised by the people in the yard not to go out at
the gate, without they were dragged out, like
brave men, they resisted, and swore that they
would never lift a hand to do any thing on board
of King George’s ships—neither would they go
out of the yard. As the key was turned upon
them, the guard was called in, and the officer of
the guard and agent plead with them, telling them
that they were put in here through mistake; and
being over-persuaded by them, they went out.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>20. Another French prize was brought in here
to-day.</p>

<p class='c000'>21. It seems that some of the sick and wounded
men that came out of Admiral Keppel’s fleet, are
recovered. They have made several attempts to
escape, and they are obliged to keep a guard here
to prevent them from running away.</p>

<p class='c000'>22. Early this morning, part of Admiral Keppel’s
fleet sailed. Last night, and this morning, a
number of Frenchmen were brought to this prison.
This afternoon, Captain Lee received a letter from
General Burgoyne; he wrote him that he would
do all he could to get bail for him.</p>

<p class='c000'>23. Sunday. Early this morning, the remainder
of Admiral Keppel’s fleet sailed, except a few
ships that are not ready. The squadron that
sailed yesterday morning, appeared this morning
in sight, off the harbor. I suppose they are all
bound on a cruise together.</p>

<p class='c000'>24. The men that gave in their names, to go on
board the men-of-war, are apprehensive that they
will not be allowed to do so, and last evening some
of them went to work to try to dig out, but upon
breaking ground they were discovered, and the
sentry discharged two guns into the hole, but they
injured no one.</p>

<p class='c000'>25. To-day, four of the five men who were
brought to this prison on the 18th of this month,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>and carried away again the next day, were brought
back because they would not enter. One of the
number was an Italian. He was put in a separate
yard, with the Frenchmen. Also, to-day a captain
of an armed vessel, that was captured by an
American privateer in the North Channel, came
here to see Captain Lee. He informed him that
he gave bonds, for a large sum of money, to return
to America as a prisoner, unless he could get Captain
Lee exchanged for him. This man is bound
for London.</p>

<p class='c000'>26. This afternoon a prize was brought in here,
which proved to be a large French West Indiaman,
a ship of about four hundred tons. Also, a
number of French prisoners were brought to prison.</p>

<p class='c000'>27. We learn from the papers, that the Parliament
is prorogued until Thursday the first of October.
We also learn from the same source, that
the damage to the French fleet, in the late engagement,
was very inconsiderable.</p>

<p class='c000'>28. This morning the guard discovered another
hole in the prison, which was begun a few days
ago; but as yet there has been but little said about
it.</p>

<p class='c000'>29. We have a paper, from which we learn
that Admiral Biron’s fleet that sailed from this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>port on the 9th of June last, bound to America,
upon their passage, met with a gale of wind
which separated the fleet and dismasted several
of their ships. The Albion has arrived in Lisbon,
dismasted. She was one of the fleet.</p>

<p class='c000'>30. Some of us are sick with fever and ague.</p>

<p class='c000'>31. Some carpenters are now at work building
a new Black-hole, in an old prison in this yard,
that has lately been repaired.</p>

<p class='c000'>September 1. It is the opinion of some in this
prison, that all the American prisoners in this yard
will be removed to some other prison, to make
room for the French prisoners, as there are now
about four hundred Frenchmen in another yard;
and there are a great number of French officers
gone into the country, on parole.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. This afternoon, Mr. Heath and Mr. Sorrey
came to see us, and brought bad news for our officers,
in a letter from the committee in London.
The contents read nearly as follows:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“Not from any prejudice or alteration in our affection
for you, but fearing that you will remain
in prison another winter, and the money raised for
your support be expended, we thought proper to
deduct two shillings per week from those officers
who have hitherto been allowed five shillings; the
other officers and privates, to remain as before.”</p>

<p class='c000'>3. Nothing remarkable.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>4. To-day four American gentlemen came to
see us; one of whom belonged to Baltimore. He
is a young man, and was bound to France to finish
his education, when he was taken. He left America
since General Clinton retreated from Philadelphia
to New York, and he gave us a very satisfactory
account of the battle—different from what
was reported to us before. This young man had
liberty to converse with us nearly two hours.</p>

<p class='c000'>5. This morning, Elias Hart, one of Captain
Lee’s company, died of consumption in the prison
hospital. He is the sixth man that has died since
I came to prison. Of late, our sick have fared much
better than formerly. As we all draw money once
a week, each respective crew contributes, weekly,
for their sick, which supplies them with every
necessary; so, that of late, there is always some
money in the bank for the use of the sick. Since
two shillings per week has been deducted from the
officers, who formerly received five, most of them,
from choice, receive what they are allowed
from subscription, in money, and draw no other
allowance than what is afforded by government.
They can buy provisions as often as they want
them, in public market, at the gate.</p>

<p class='c000'>6. Sunday. This afternoon, three American
captains came to see us. They have been taken
some months, and are bound directly home.—Among
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>the number, there is one Captain Potter,
belonging to Boston.</p>

<p class='c000'>7. Several of our men have been taken sick
with fever and ague, within a few days, and a great
number in prison are unwell.</p>

<p class='c000'>8. This afternoon, thirteen American prisoners
were brought to prison. They were lately brought
round from Liverpool, and are the remainder of
Captain Ravel’s crew.</p>

<p class='c000'>9. To-day, one Thomas Pillar, of Portsmouth,
visited us. He was one of the five who were
brought here on the 18th of August; he was carried
on board the men-of-war the next day, having
been taken in a merchantman. They kept him for
a time, but he has since received his discharge,
and intends to return home. Several letters were
delivered to him to carry, and he is to call and
get more.</p>

<p class='c000'>10. This afternoon, Rev. Mr. Heath came to
see us, in company with a young American gentleman,
who has been taken, lately, on his passage
to France. Our agent, or prison-keeper, being
sick and absent, Mr. Heath came into prison and
discoursed nearly two hours with the officers.</p>

<p class='c000'>11. We have accounts in the papers, that Winchester
castle is to be repaired for the reception
of one hundred American prisoners—a larger
number than they now have in England.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>12. Captain Burnel, who is a prisoner here, taken
in the American service, and has a wife and
family in England, has received a letter from
his wife, informing him that she has been turned
out of doors, wholly on account of his being in the
American service. The prisoners are about raising
money for her relief.</p>

<p class='c000'>13. Sunday. This afternoon, Captain Rols received
a letter from Captain Harris, in Portsmouth
prison. He informs him that forty-five officers and
eleven privates, had made their escape lately, out
of that prison, twenty-five of whom were brought
back—the other thirty-one had got off.</p>

<p class='c000'>14. We are informed, that last evening, a French
privateer was brought in here, with eighty prisoners
on board, and the sailors having got a number
of prostitutes, and gone below, drinking, the
Frenchmen rose, closed the hatches on them, cut
the cable and went off with the vessel.</p>

<p class='c000'>15. To-day, several letters were received here,
from the prisoners at Portsmouth. They inform
us that they have received a letter from Captain
Cowes, in France, who made his escape from that
prison. He writes that he has been at Paris, and
conversed with Dr. Franklin, and told him our
situation. His answer was, that he expected orders
from America for the release of all of us.—This
agrees with a letter which was received by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>the prisoners in Portsmouth, from a gentleman in
London. In conversation with Mr. Heartley, who
is a great speaker in the House of Commons, he
informed him, that it lay in Dr. Franklin’s power
to exchange us when he pleases. It seems by
their writing, that they give credit to the report;
but our faith has been so long tried, and we have
been flattered so often, many in prison will not
believe that they are going, until they see the prison
gates open.</p>

<p class='c000'>16. Considerable rain in the first part of the
day. I believe there has not been two hours steady
rain, before to-day, for nearly three months. To-day
some jackets, shirts and stockings were given
us by the agent, by order of the Board. I received
one shirt, which is the only one I have received
from Government, since I have been a prisoner.</p>

<p class='c000'>17. The West India fleet that put in here a few
days ago, sailed to-day, bound up channel. We
heard that most of their hands were pressed, and
that they were manned by men-of-wars-men. To-day
I finished my studies in navigation.</p>

<p class='c000'>18. To-day Captain Lee received a letter from
a man that was here a few weeks ago, and who informed
him that he was taken by an American
privateer, and came home upon condition that he
was to return to America, if he could not get Captain
Lee exchanged for him. He now writes that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>he has done his utmost, but it is impossible for
any man to get out, so long as this Act is in
force.</p>

<p class='c000'>19. To-day about forty French prisoners were
brought to prison, who were captured in a privateer.
There are now about five hundred French
prisoners here.</p>

<p class='c000'>20. To-day Thomas Pillar came again to see
us. He informed us that he expects to sail this
afternoon. They are first bound to Ireland, to
join a fleet; from thence, to New York. A number
in prison sent letters by him. I sent one to
my father. He also informs us that he is to work
for his passage, and that he has no money to purchase
his sea stores. We collected about sixteen
shillings, and gave it to him.</p>

<p class='c000'>21. I expected that Admiral Keppel’s fleet
would have come in before this time, on account
of the sun’s crossing the line; but they are not
yet in, so that I am in daily expectation of hearing
that there has been an engagement between the
two fleets.</p>

<p class='c000'>To-day, eight more of our sick were carried into
the prison hospital. They are attacked with
fever and ague, and a number more are very unwell
with the same complaint; and I am afraid
it will be very sickly among us, unless cold weather
sets in very soon.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>22. To-day is King George’s coronation day,
and between twelve and one o’clock the fort and
garrison fired a salute. There was but very little
firing to what there was last year, on account of
there being but few ships in the port. To-day,
also, one Captain Smith came to see us. He belongs
to Portsmouth. He was taken in a merchantman
bound to the West Indies, and brought in
here. His men are all put on board the men-of-war;
but he has got his liberty, and is bound
home. A great number in prison will send letters
by him.</p>

<p class='c000'>23. There are a great many in prison, who contemplate
having the beef which we receive from
subscription, and the soap, tobacco, and oatmeal,
and the herbs which we have in our broth, all taken
off, and receive a white loaf and some money
instead of them. In order to ascertain the mind
of the majority, we all drew up in the yard
and passed a vote, which was in favor of the
change; but whether the gentlemen, Mr. Heath
and Mr. Sorrey, will agree to it or not, we do not
know; or whether the agent will allow the money
to come into the yard, is not yet determined. I
was for receiving the provisions, fearing that if the
money was allowed to come into the yard, it would
be attended with many bad consequences—too
many to enumerate here.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>24. This afternoon, Captain Smith came to see
us again, and took our letters. I sent one by him
to my father. To-day our small beer was very
bad, and we refused to take it; they afterwards
got some that was a very little better; but a great
part in prison carried theirs and turned it over the
gate, before the eyes of the prison officers, chosing
rather, to drink water. The prison has been in an
uproar all day, it being donation day. Several in
prison became intoxicated, and went to fighting;
but after a few battles the prison was again quiet.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>September</span> 25. To-day Captain Ellenwood,
belonging to Beverly, came to see us; he was
taken, but has since been discharged, and is now
bound home. A great number of letters were
sent by him; I sent one to my brother. Last
night, one Captain Rols made his escape from a
separate prison, incognito, and it was not discovered
till eleven o’clock to-day; and would not
then have been, had it not been for his messmates,
who, when they drew provisions, told of it; fearing
that if they drew for him, they would be
brought into trouble, as there are express orders
against it.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>26. To-day two French prizes were brought
into this port.</p>

<p class='c000'>27. Sunday. Last night, a young man in this
prison, having a mind to go on board the men-of-war,
made his escape over the wall in a shower
of rain, and was not discovered. He was one of
the number that lately petitioned to go on board
the ships. To-day several more of the sick were
carried down to the prison hospital. I think there
is more than double the number sick now than
has been at any time since I have been in prison,
except when the small-pox went through the prison.
If a man is sick, and very bad, the doctor will
take him to the hospital a few days, as a matter
of form. He has served several thus, and sent
them up again before they were half recovered,
and oftentimes when they were scarcely able to
walk.</p>

<p class='c000'>28. To-day our clothing was examined, as of
late has been customary once a month, and as
they called the roll they missed the man that made
his escape the night before last; but they know
when, where, or how he went.</p>

<p class='c000'>29. We learn, by the paper, that General Carlton
has arrived home; and also that Parliament is prorogued
till the 26th of November.</p>

<p class='c000'>30. Wet, stormy weather, which renders our
confinement very tedious. We are informed that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>a few French prisoners, who made their escape a
few nights ago, out of a prison in a separate yard,
got a boat and set out for France, but meeting
with the storm, put about and came back again,
and delivered themselves up.</p>

<p class='c000'>October 1. The first part of last night was very
dark, and stormy, and had it not cleared away
just as it did before the moon set, immediately
after she set there would have been an elopement
from this and the officers’ prison; but as it was,
one Captain Ravel made his escape from the
officers’ prison, incognito, which I hope hereafter
fully to describe. Our new Black-hole is finished
to punish Yankees in, and to-day a man was put
in for little or nothing—for what they call abusing
the turnkey—and ever since he has been in,
he has been cutting with a small penknife, and has
got a hole through the door near six inches
square. To-day nearly one hundred Frenchmen
were brought to prison; they were taken in a
French East Indiaman.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. Last night one Mr. Kirk made his escape
from the officers’ prison; he took the same method
that Captains Rols and Ravel did before him.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. This morning, when the guard came to let
the officers out, they missed Captain Ravel and
Mr. Kirk, but they knew not when, where, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>how they went, so they made no great stir about
them.</p>

<p class='c000'>4. Sunday. This forenoon a gentleman came
with a pardon for thirty-three men that petitioned
to go on board the men-of-war, which was nearly
as follows:</p>

<p class='c000'>“His Majesty has been graciously pleased to
grant a free pardon to thirty-three men, by name
——, resident in this prison, upon condition that
they will serve, and continue to serve in His
Majesty’s Navy.” This gentleman said that these
men are to be taken out of prison to-morrow, but
one of the thirty-three has lately made his escape,
and we have heard since that he is on board a
man-of-war. He also said that those whose names
are not on the list, but wish to enter on board
the men-of-war, if they would petition, the same
course would be taken, and he had no doubt it
would be answered to their satisfaction. Accordingly,
this afternoon a petition was written, and
about fourteen signed it.</p>

<p class='c000'>6. Last night there was but very little sleep in
this prison, for the men who went on board the
men-of-war this morning, were so overjoyed at the
thought of being released from prison, that they
could not, or would not, sleep the fore part of the
night, but ran about the prison, hallooing, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>stamping, and singing, like mad-men, till they
were tired out, and then went to bed; but the rest in
prison were resolved, as they would not let us
sleep the first part of the night, we would not let
them sleep the latter; accordingly, we all turned
out, and had an Indian Pow-wow, and as solid as
the prison is, we made it shake. In this manner
we spent the night, and in the morning early the
men were called out, twenty of whom were immediately
carried on board the Russel ship-of-war,
now lying in the Sound. The other twelve were
taken out about eleven o’clock, and sent on board
the Royal George, now lying in Plymouth dock.
As they went out, they gave us three cheers; we
returned it, for in joy we parted. Among those
who went to-day were about a dozen Americans,
but they were chiefly inconsiderate youths. This
is a move that I have long wished to see, but it
came now very unexpectedly. For my own part, to
enter on board a ship of war is the last thing I
would do. I would undergo every thing but
death before I would think of such a thing. This
prison has been a little hell upon earth, but I
prefer it as much before a man-of-war, as I would
a palace before a dungeon. Ten days ago there
were 330 prisoners here, now there are only 294.</p>

<p class='c000'>6. There is a great alteration to be seen in this
prison since those men went away, and I make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>no doubt that after another draft, we shall have
peace and tranquillity, and live in harmony, and
make ourselves happy, considering our situation,
to what we have been for months past.</p>

<p class='c000'>7. This morning, when Mr. Sorrey came to
bring us our money, he desired the butcher to tell
us that we might depend upon it that a cartel was
settled, and that we are very soon to be exchanged
for prisoners in France. The strongest circumstance
that induces us to believe it is, that those
men were admitted on board the men-of-war.
This news also agrees with a letter which we received
clandestinely from Captain Harris, in Portsmouth
prison; he writes that a Rev. gentleman,
who has been a friend from the beginning, told
him that there was actually a cartel negotiating.</p>

<p class='c000'>8. Nothing remarkable, but repeated confirmations
of what we have heard before.</p>

<p class='c000'>9. It is four months to-day since Admiral Biron’s
fleet sailed from the Sound, and as yet we
have heard of no arrival, except one ship. Also,
this afternoon the brewer that supplies us with
beer, through a mistake brought a cask of strong
beer instead of malt, and he did not find out his
mistake until he got here, and so was obliged to
carry it back again. Afterwards, he brought us
some that was small enough, and was not according
to contract; we received it, but several took
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>theirs and turned it over the gate. The man that
was put in the Black-hole, nine days ago, has
ever since been punished unjustly, and to-day he
was resolved to get out, and we were resolved to
get him out. After tearing the Black-hole yard
down, which is about twenty feet long and eight
wide, he got out and came into this prison, and in
the afternoon the whole guard came in with their
arms, and demanded the man. But, with one accord,
we all said that he should not be punished
unjustly, and if they put him in the Black-hole
it should not stand an hour. All this time the
man had posted himself advantageously upon a
beam over head in this prison, with a large stone
in each hand, and a stocking full besides, swearing,
in a most determined manner, that he would
crack the first man’s skull that offered to touch
him. The guard went in to persuade him to go
peaceably, but he would not, and they dared not,
or did not touch him; and after a long controversy,
they went out without him.</p>

<p class='c000'>10. We learn, by the papers, that the Fox frigate,
and a ship of eighteen guns, and one of sixteen
guns, are taken by the French and carried
into France.</p>

<p class='c000'>11. Sunday. To-day we received a pound of
potatoes per man, instead of cabbage, which the
late draught has rendered very scarce.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>12. To-day three letters were received in this
prison, from prisoners in Portsmouth. They agree
concerning the cartel which is expected to take
place. They write that passports are signed and
passed from Dr. Franklin to the ministry. They
write, also, that they had it from the American
agent in Paris.</p>

<p class='c000'>13. To-day, a fleet consisting of fifty sail, with
convoy, passed this harbor. We suppose them to
be an outward bound West India fleet.</p>

<p class='c000'>14. Last night Captain Lee made his escape
from the officers’ prison, in the same manner that
Captain Rols and others did, before him; and
there are several others who are fixed, and only
waiting for an opportunity to go the same way.</p>

<p class='c000'>15. It is twenty-three months to-day since I left
Newbury. This morning when the guard counted
the officers out, they missed one; and after a
long search, they found it to be Captain Lee. But
all they know about it, is that he is gone.</p>

<p class='c000'>16. As it is twelve months to-day since General
Burgoyne was taken, in commemoration thereof,
at one o’clock, we all drew up in the yard, and
gave three cheers: and at night, before we were
turned in, we did the same. This afternoon, seven
more American prisoners were brought to prison.
They were lately brought from Liverpool, and
were captured in different vessels.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>17. For two days past, there have been no
doctors here to attend to our sick, and I hear that
the chief physician at the royal hospital has the
charge of them. To-day a number were removed
into this prison, from a separate prison, called the
itchy ward, to make room for the sick. The masons
are now at work, building a chimney in an
old prison, in this yard, that has lately been repaired.
This prison is to be made an hospital for
the sick, as the other hospital is wanted for the
French prisoners; for there is between five and
six hundred of them in one large prison, in a separate
yard, and they are very sickly. They have
the spotted fever among them, which was brought
by those taken in the French East Indiaman.</p>

<p class='c000'>18. Sunday. Yesterday the officers in the
other prisons received a private letter from without,
which confirms the news concerning a cartel,
giving the particulars, which causes great satisfaction
in the yard.</p>

<p class='c000'>19. A man in prison received a letter from the
Russell, ship-of-war, which is now lying in the
Sound, from those who went on board from this
prison. They write that they are bound to a
station in the East Indies.</p>

<p class='c000'>20. This morning a pardon arrived from the
King, for the fourteen men who petitioned to go
on board the King’s ships.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>21. This morning, the same man that brought
the first draft, came, and called over the names of
those fourteen men, and asked them of what country
they were, and how long they had been to sea.
Two of them being sick of their bargain, denied
that their names were there.</p>

<p class='c000'>I am in hopes of soon hearing that Rhode Island
is taken, for I hear that the British troops
there, have burnt five frigates and two sloops-of-war,
fearing that they would fall into the hands
of the Americans. From the same source we
learn that the Albion, a ship of sixty-four guns, is
taken by the French, and carried into France.—Also,
that four sail of the line have lately sailed
from France, bound to America, to join Count
D’Estaing; and also, that the English have taken
another East Indiaman from the French, besides
that which was brought in here.</p>

<p class='c000'>22. To-day some officers from the ships came
after those men, and the two before mentioned denied
that they signed their names. They did not
ask them to go, but one man went that did not
sign, so that on the whole they got thirteen, which,
with the first draft, makes forty-five men that
have gone on board the men-of-war. But those
who remain, I believe, are true sons of America.</p>

<p class='c000'>23. Notwithstanding the encouragement we
have about being exchanged, last evening a man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>made his escape by getting over the wall. It being
very dark and rainy, more would have gone the
same way, but they were discovered by the guard.</p>

<p class='c000'>24. It is twenty-two months to-day, that I have
been a prisoner; but now I think the auspicious
day is at hand, when, with God’s blessing, we shall
all take our departure from this place. If I mistake
not, this is the only day since I have been a
prisoner, that we have not been counted. But
this morning we were let out, and at night turned
in, without any such thing; so that it appears
they grow very careless about us to what they
have been, which I consider a good omen.</p>

<p class='c000'>25. Sunday. One hundred and one Sundays
have passed since I have enjoyed a Sabbath day’s
privilege. To-day being King Charles’ restoration
day, the garrison and fort fired a salute.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>October</span> 26. It is twenty-three months to-day,
since we sailed in the brig Dolton from Portsmouth.
It is a long time since this prison was
smoked, so that it is exceedingly foul, and smells
very offensive. To-day, by order of Dr. Far, the
principal physician of the royal hospital, who has
now the care of our sick, some stuff was procured,
which they tell us is the oil of tar, which was put
on the posts fore and aft the prison, above and below.
They inform us that it is better than smoking.
Be it as it may, it gives the prison a very disagreeable
smell.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>27. As the evenings are now of considerable
length, although we are not allowed candles, yet
we have them every night, and have had them for
several weeks past.</p>

<p class='c000'>28. Last night the French prisoners broke out
of their prison, through a hole which they had dug
several yards under ground. I cannot learn the
exact number that got out. However, they were
discovered by the guard and pursued, and one of
them was shot through the breast. After which,
a turnkey struck him on the head with an iron poker,
but he is yet alive. The Frenchmen are very
sickly; they have the spotted fever amongst them,
which carries off great numbers.</p>

<p class='c000'>This morning, Mr. Heath and Mr. Sorrey came
to see us, and informed us that they had received
a letter from the committee, in London, with orders
to deduct sixpence per week from each officer,
and ninepence from each private; so that for
the future, the officers are to receive two shillings
and sixpence each, per week, and privates one
shilling and threepence each, per week. All the
reason I can assign for this change, is, that the
donation grows short.</p>

<p class='c000'>29. The camp at Coxheath is now broken up,
and the Somersetshire militia, with the 13th
regiment, have removed to the barracks at Plymouth
dock; so that one day we are guarded by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>the militia, and the other by the 13th regiment.—To-day,
about fifty Frenchmen were removed from
a separate prison, in another yard, to the prison-ship,
for want of room in that prison.</p>

<p class='c000'>30. To-day Mr. Sorrey came and answered a
petition which we sent out, to receive what we are
allowed in money, as it is so trifling. Mr. Sorrey
says that Mr. Heath is absent, so that he will continue
the provisions until he returns, and then he
will consult him.</p>

<p class='c000'>31. We learn, from the papers, that Lord Howe
and Sir George Johnston, have arrived home in
the Eagle man-of-war, of sixty-four guns.</p>

<p class='c000'>November 1. This afternoon two Americans
were brought to the gate, in irons, having four or
five men, with pistols, guarding them; but who
they were, or where they were taken, I cannot tell.
I suppose, however, that they were not committed,
by their being carried away again.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. It is almost four weeks since Mr. Sorrey told
us that we were to be exchanged; and some in
prison, who believed it at first, begin to think it
very doubtful; some did not believe it at first. For
my own part, I am persuaded it is true, and believe
it will be soon—how soon I cannot tell; but
every day since I heard of it, seems as long as a
week before.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. At this time we have several holes in hand,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>one of which was discovered this morning, by some
dirt that was carried out in the tubs to the edge
of the river, to empty. To-day two large two-deckers
came in, which, I suppose, belong to Admiral
Keppel’s fleet; and hear that they are all in
Portsmouth, and other ports. I also hear that the
Ocean, a three-decker, a ship of ninety guns,
which came in a few days ago in a storm which
she experienced, sprung a leak, and threw overboard
most of her guns.</p>

<p class='c000'>4. To-day Mr. Sorrey came, and brought some
money for the officers, but none for us, as our
provisions for the week past amounts to what we
are allowed. Mr. Sorrey says that he expects the
cartel very soon. The Lord have mercy upon us,
if it does not arrive before the donation is all expended,
for the second death will be worse than
the first.</p>

<p class='c000'>5. To-day, being gunpowder treason, at one
o’clock the garrison and fort fired a salute, and the
bells in Plymouth have been chiming most of the
day.</p>

<p class='c000'>6. To-day about one hundred more of the
French prisoners in another yard, were removed
on board the Cambridge, a prison ship. For several
days past, a number of men have been at work
laying the foundation of a large prison hospital,
which is to be built.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>It has been strongly reported this week, that Dominica
has been taken by the French and Americans,
and this evening I had the pleasure of seeing
it confirmed, in the paper, by authority. The
Lieutenant Governor of that Island is now a
prisoner in France.</p>

<p class='c000'>7. We learn, by the paper, that the King’s
troops in America, have been to Martha’s Vineyard,
disarmed the inhabitants, and demanded ten
thousand sheep and five hundred oxen.</p>

<p class='c000'>8. Sunday. Nothing very remarkable. Various
conjectures concerning a cartel. Some imagine
it is to come from France; others think it
will be fitted out in England, and others are doubtful
if it will come at all.</p>

<p class='c000'>9. I thought that all who had any idea of going
on board the men-of-war, had gone; but I understand
that a number have sent their names out, to
go; how many I cannot tell, as they did it very
slyly. We shall know who they are, and how
many, when an order comes to take them out.</p>

<p class='c000'>10. This morning two of our men got some
liquor, clandestinely, and made themselves drunk.
One of these, about twelve o’clock, went to the
gate to buy some strong beer, which was denied
him, and being in a passion, without any provocation,
he swore that he would break the agent’s
windows, and took up some old shoes, bones and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>stones, and threw them till he had broken
seven squares in one window, and one in another,
in the front of the agent’s office. There
being three of them intoxicated, one of them took
hold of the sentry at the gate, and would have taken
his gun from him, but the guard came in, and
the captain of the guard took hold of one of them,
and being a militia man, and a very great gentleman,
he said that he was lothe to bring his men
who were armed, against us who were unarmed,
and so went out. Upon which, we took one of
them ourselves and pitched him out of the gate
by the nape of the neck, and so delivered him up.
In the afternoon, after we were turned out, we
took the other two and delivered them up. All of
which were sent to the Black-hole. So, that if
any man misbehaves and deserves punishment, we
will deliver him up, or punish him ourselves, rather
than he should go unpunished; but rather than see
a man chastised unjustly, we will do our utmost
for his rescue. As for instance, on the 19th of
October, when we released one of these same
men from the Black-hole.</p>

<p class='c000'>11. Those three men who were put in the
Black-hole yesterday, employed themselves last
night, in cutting through the bulkhead that separates
the Black-hole from the hospital, and piled
up the chips and set them on fire. Where they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>obtained the fire we cannot tell, but they were
soon glad enough to put it out, as the smoke increased.
This afternoon four American boys came
to see us, that were taken with Captain Claston, in
the Freedom, above twelve months ago. Those
boys were detained, and now belong to the Apollo
frigate.</p>

<p class='c000'>12. As a fortnight has passed, and we have received
no money, we begin to fear that we shall
receive no more; but what is left of the donation,
I expect we shall receive in clothes and provision;
and for that reason, and the want of employment,
I to-day began to make boxes.</p>

<p class='c000'>13. We learn, from the paper, that the Fortune
privateer, Captain George Tarton, which was formerly
the Dolton, has made more money by privateering,
than any other privateer out of England,
since the commencement of hostilities between the
English and French.</p>

<p class='c000'>14. Last evening, it being dark and rainy, two
holes were opened at the back part of the prison,
and five men went out. They had agreed with a
soldier to let them pass for so much money. This
soldier’s name was Mitchell; he was once a stage-driver
in America. He let them out, and they
gave him two pounds nineteen shillings; but after
they delivered him the money, he let them out
where the guard stood ready to receive them and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>carry them to the Black-hole. This morning, the
guard went into the officers’ prison and discovered
a hole under the stairs, where they had dug down
about six feet, and then proceeded through the
guard-house and came up under the guard bed.—They
then went up stairs and demanded the keys
of the officers’ chests, which they opened, and
found a suit of uniform which one of the officers
had purchased to make his escape in. This was
the method Captains Rols, Ravel, Lee, and Mr.
Kirk took to make their escape,—following the
guard out when they used to come at night; but
this scheme is blasted. The hole in the officers’
prison had been finished near a month, and they
had been only waiting for an opportunity to put
their plans into execution; but as this Mitchell
has appeared to be a friend, I suppose that some
one of the officers communicated it to him, and he
informed his officer; so by that means it was discovered.</p>

<p class='c000'>This afternoon Mr. Sorrey and Mr. Heath came
to see us, and we presented them with a letter of
thanks for the many favors we have received at
their hands, and requested them to let us have
part of what we are to receive, in money. This
favor we probably shall obtain. We have not received
any coals from government, for the comfort
of our sick in the hospital, for nearly six weeks,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>but have been obliged to use the donation coals.
We informed Mr. Heath and Mr. Sorrey of this,
and we find that we have been cheated, by the
agent and doctor, out of nearly forty bushels of
coals.</p>

<p class='c000'>15. Sunday. It is two years to-day since I left
Newbury. Alas! little did I think that I should
be here now. Last night, a hole that we have had
in hand nearly a fortnight, unfortunately foundered
in the street. This hole was dug down by
the side of the prison, about ten feet, and our intention
was to dig across the street under ground,
into a garden on the opposite side of the way; but,
by the time it was half across, it foundered.</p>

<p class='c000'>16. Night before last, we heard a firing which
we could not account for. We have since heard
that the Royal George ran ashore from her moorings,
but was got of again with but little trouble.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>November</span> 17. Tuesday. I am twenty-one
years of age. Alas! little did I think, three years
ago, that at this age I should have spent so much
of my time immersed in prison. A sorrowful
freedom this; or rather no freedom at all. There
has been nothing to be purchased within these
walls to-day, to drink, but cold water, and we
came near having nothing to eat; for, it being
rainy last night, some in prison broke a hole
through the wall, with the intent to go out, but
were discovered, and this morning our butcher
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>went out to cut the meat up, but the agent put all
in prison on half allowance, and then went off.
When the butcher came in, we told the cooks not
to cut the meat up, for we would not receive half
allowance. About 4 o’clock in the afternoon the
agent came back, in a great passion, swearing by
all that was good or bad, that all in this prison
should go on half allowance. The men that dug
the hole offered to go to the Black-hole, but he
refused their offer; but after a long controversy,
he became a little more calm, and took the men
and gave us our allowance, which we received
about dark.</p>

<p class='c000'>18. For several days past, a large number of
men have been at work upon an island, called
Drake’s Island. It seems that they have been
building new works; I suppose for fear that a landing
may be attempted by the French; and another
fort is building further up the river.</p>

<p class='c000'>19. To-day Joseph Burnham, one of our company,
who had his leg cut off some months ago,
has so far recovered as to come up into this yard.</p>

<p class='c000'>20. We learn, by the papers, that 10,000 troops
are to be sent to America in the spring, and the
war is to be pushed with the utmost vigor, both by
sea and land.</p>

<p class='c000'>21. To-day we received a letter from Mr. Sorrey
and Mr. Heath, which informs us that the beef
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>shall be deducted, which we have received by subscription,
and the other articles continued as before,
and that we shall receive sixpence per week
in money, according to our request.</p>

<p class='c000'>22. Sunday. Wet, dirty weather, as it has
been for three or four weeks past, in which time
there has scarcely been a day in which it has not
rained more or less.</p>

<p class='c000'>23. This evening I had the privilege of hearing
the London Evening Post read, which is a paper
we seldom see, and in which is a burlesque on the
Ministry, very severe.</p>

<p class='c000'>24. I have been a prisoner three-and-twenty
months to-day.</p>

<p class='c000'>25. To-day we received sixpence per man, and
the beef was deducted; the rest of the provisions
continue, which, with sixpence per week, amounts
to what we are allowed—fifteen pence, as before
mentioned. This afternoon, the men in the Black-hole,
being vexed by ill usage, and not being allowed
to come out and take the air, broke down the
Black-hole door, which alarmed the guard, and
the agent ordered five of them to be put in irons;
but the militia being on guard, and the officer being
a great gentleman, he put only one of them in
irons.</p>

<p class='c000'>26. It is two years to-day since we sailed in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>brig Dolton from Portsmouth. To-day the Parliament
is to set, according to adjournment.</p>

<p class='c000'>27. Wet, rainy, blustering, unsteady weather,
which renders our confinement more tedious than
in good weather, on account of our being obliged
to keep house a great part of the time. At present,
many in prison are destitute of shoes, and of
late our prison has become very leaky. Along
through the last of summer and the first of fall,
for nearly three months, there was scarcely rain
enough to wet the dust; but now, for a month
past, there has been scarcely a day but there has
been more or less rain; so that the grass in the
fields looks much better now than it did in the
month of August, when the fields were parched
up for want of rain.</p>

<p class='c000'>28. Nothing remarkable.</p>

<p class='c000'>29. Sunday. To-day William Moody came to
see us; I had not the least expectation of ever
seeing him again in these parts, for I expected
that he had got home before this, as he was cleared
a long time ago. Where he has been ever
since I cannot tell, but he tells us that he is now
a carpenter of a privateer of eight guns, belonging
to this port, in which he has been one cruise,
and taken one French St. Domingo vessel.</p>

<p class='c000'>30. Nothing remarkable.</p>

<p class='c000'>December 1. This evening I had the privilege
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>of reading the London Evening Post, in which is
an account of the capture of three English frigates,
by name the Minerva and the Acton, carried
into the West Indies, and the Thundering
Unicorn, into Boston.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. This afternoon, one John Howe came to see
us. He made his escape out of this prison
a few months ago, and went on board the Blenheim,
a guard ship in this port; and as he was
one that petitioned to go on board the men-of-war,
after he made his escape his pardon came
down for him with the rest; so that he may come
on shore, as often as he can get liberty, with safety.
He induced two of the number who petitioned
last to run away, at night, when they went out
with their tubs, which they did, and a boy with
them, but they were pursued by the guard, taken,
and lodged in the Black-hole.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. The three that were put in the Black-hole
last night were taken out to-day. To-day I had
the opportunity of seeing and reading the King’s
speech on the 26th of last month, in which he
seems very cool and moderate to what he was at
the opening of the session last year. His speech
was not long, but too long to be comprehended
here; but he confesses that his arms have not met
with the success that the justness of the cause and
their exertions promised; and I think that he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>seems rather inclined to peace, as he says, if it can
be attained consistently with the honor and dignity
of the crown.</p>

<p class='c000'>4. This evening we had two papers in prison,
the Exeter paper and the London Evening Post;
in the latter were the proceedings of Parliament.
This paper says that the King was never seen to
look so melancholy, and to speak so sorrowful, as
on the 26th of Nov. last; and he was never seen to
exert himself, except when he addressed the House
of Commons for support. In the same paper are
several fine speeches in favor of America; they
lament the loss of Dominica, and deplore the situation
of Great Britain and all her foreign territories.</p>

<p class='c000'>5. Last evening Mr. Anthony Shomaker privately
made his escape from the officers’ prison,
and but very few in this yard knew any thing of
it until this evening; and neither the agent nor
the guard know it yet, which makes it well for the
mess he left, as they draw his provisions. But
this is not the only thing; the reason we keep it
from them is that he may have a better chance to
get off, and to screen the militia on guard at the
time.</p>

<p class='c000'>6. Sunday. By this time I begin to feel very
sad about our cartel, for I expected that it
would have been here before this time, but I entertain
the same opinion, about its being agreed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>upon, now, as I did at first; I am fearful, however,
that something has turned up to prevent its being
put in execution.</p>

<p class='c000'>7. We were all called to muster just before
night. We thought it was on account of Mr.
Shomaker being gone, but we were soon convinced
to the contrary, as they did not find it out
till his name was called; and I have heard since
that the Board sent down for an immediate list of
all the prisoners here. There are various conjectures
concerning this uncommon affair; some are
encouraged by it, others not.</p>

<p class='c000'>8. We learn, from the papers, that there are
7000 English prisoners in and about Brest.</p>

<p class='c000'>9. To-day Mr. Coudry, the agent, and Mr.
Turner, his clerk, told us that we should be exchanged
very soon; it was but a few days ago
that they contradicted the story concerning a cartel,
and wanted to entice us to enter on board the
men-of-war, so that I pay no regard to what they
say, whether it be for us, or against us.</p>

<p class='c000'>10. To-day the story concerning a cartel is rumored
again; we are told that the transports are
engaged for that purpose; and some say that we
shall be gone in a fortnight, others in a month.</p>

<p class='c000'>11. At this time, there is considerable bad
money in prison, which was brought and handed
in as change for good money, by some of the turnkeys
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>or market people, and now that they begin
to be suspicious of our going away soon, they will
take no more of it, though it has passed in and
out for several months, so that there is considerable
laying on our hands, which we are obliged
to lose. Some in prison have several shillings in
bad half pence.</p>

<p class='c000'>12. I fear that I shall forever have cause to remember
this day, to my sorrow; for this morning,
when we were turned out, it was reported from
the officers’ prison that the Act by which we were
committed was again renewed, but upon further
inquiry, and upon searching the paper, we found
it to be nearly as follows: Sir Gray Cooper made
a motion in the House for leave to bring in a bill
to renew this act, for a certain limited time, which
passed without a debate. But the worst is yet to
come; Mr. Heath and Mr. Sorrey, who hitherto
have been messengers of good news, came this
afternoon with tidings of bad news, in a letter
from the committee in London, which gives an account
of all the donation being expended. This
occasions many long faces in prison; but in this
letter there is a word of comfort, for they write
that the time is so short which we have to stay in
prison, that they thought it not worth while to
open a new subscription, though they have the
same feelings for us that they ever had; which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>seems to imply, that if it was necessary, or if we
were to stay here long, they would do it again.</p>

<p class='c000'>13. Sunday. The sudden, disagreeable, and
unexpected news that we received yesterday, has
greatly added to our affliction, and this is the last
day that we may expect any thing from the donation.
To-day we received a fourpenny white
loaf per mess, which came last night; so that
from this time we may bid it adieu. This donation
has lasted exactly eleven months and one day;
so that it was eleven months yesterday since we
received the first of it. Doubtless many of us
would have been in our graves before this day,
had it not been for this; and heaven, I hope, will
reward the donors.</p>

<p class='c000'>14. To-day we received another fourpenny loaf
per mess; the occasion of it I cannot tell. Last
evening, about eight o’clock, Mr. Hyfield made
his escape from the officers’ prison, in disguise;
and about ten o’clock another attempted it in the
same way, but was discovered, and sent to the
Black-hole. There are a number sick in another
prison in this yard, which is called a hospital; but
it is not worth the name, as there is no fire-place
in it, neither is it water tight, but whenever it
rains, as it has done most of the time of late, it
beats in upon the sick as they lay in their beds.
At this time there are several sick with the fever,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>three, of whom now appear to be at the point of
death.</p>

<p class='c000'>15. Last evening John Lott died with fever;
he was an Indian that was taken with Captain
Brown, in the sloop Charming Sally. He is the
seventh man that has died in prison since I came
here, and he is the seventh that Captain Brown
has lost of his men since he was taken. Six of
our crew have died since we were taken, two
of Captain Lee’s, and one of Captain Henry
Johnson’s. There are two men in prison who
lay dangerously sick, and to-day we got leave for
Mr. Heath to come and pray with them, which is
the only public prayer that has been made in this
yard since we came to prison. I think it not
amiss to mention a few words that this Rev. gentleman
said concerning the sick. He said that
they should be supplied with such necessaries as
they wanted for their comfort, if he had to go
about the country with a bag and beg them. To-day
we came upon our old government allowance,
which, I must confess, is better than it was in
1777; the quantity is the same, except half a pint
of peas on Saturday, which we were then cheated
out of; our beef and bread are the same in quantity,
but better in quality. To-day the agent
served out a few clothes to such as were in immediate
need, but poor Charles gets none.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>16. To-day the sick were removed from one
prison, in this yard, to another that has been some
time preparing for them.</p>

<p class='c000'>17. Yesterday the captain of the grenadiers in
the 13th regiment was on guard; last evening he
came into this prison and used two or three men
very ill. As this man has lately boasted that no
man could make his escape while he was on guard,
and as they had not found out that Mr. Hyfield
was gone, who made his escape several evenings
ago, and on account of the captain’s insolence
and abuse last evening, we let them know it this
morning, so that they think he went away on this
captain’s guard, and the blame, if there is any,
will fall upon his head. To-day, by the request
of the whole prison, a letter of thanks was written,
and sent to the honorable committee in London,
and we desired that it might be made public,
by putting it in the paper. As there was something
in it which we did not wish the agent to
see, we sent it out by the officer of the guard,
who, being a gentleman in the militia, and approving
mightily of it, promised to forward it on
its way.</p>

<p class='c000'>18. A report has prevailed in prison, to-day,
that information has been received that two ships
have been engaged, in Portsmouth, to carry us to
Boston.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>19. Last night Captain Alexander Ross made
his escape from the officers’ prison. Our officers
that have made their escape so many times lately,
may thank good friends and their money for getting
off; but a poor foremast hand, with no friends,
and no money in his pocket, would stand but a
poor chance to get off, if he was without the
walls.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>December</span> 20. We learn, by the papers, that the
ministry are resolved to carry on another campaign
in America; and, if they can do nothing
else, spread horror and depredation from one end
of the continent to the other. They have a new
mode for carrying on the war; as I believe they
have given up all idea of conquering the country.
They mean now, to destroy their seaports, and
render the country of as little use to France as
possible; but poor old England is in a deplorable
situation, and this, I believe, will be her last dying
struggle.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>Thirty-one lords have drawn up a protest against
this new system of war, to warn the public and to
screen themselves from the evil that may fall upon
those who persist in this inhuman and bloody conflict.</p>

<p class='c000'>21. There has been no answer to the last petition
that was sent to the Board; and to-day another
petition was written and signed by a considerable
number. This short allowance strikes such
a dread upon a great number in this prison, that I
am afraid it will frighten many, and induce them
to go on board the men-of-war, who otherwise
would have no thoughts of going. For my own
part, I have received about a half a guinea for
boxes, of late, but if I had not a farthing it would
be equally the same, for as long as I can get provision
enough to keep body and soul together, I
shall prefer this prison to a man-of-war.</p>

<p class='c000'>22. Last evening Mr. Salter made his escape
from the officers’ prison. Captain Boardman
attempted it, but was discovered, and put in the
Black-hole.</p>

<p class='c000'>We learn, by the papers, that the high treason
Act is again renewed; for how long a time, is uncertain.</p>

<p class='c000'>23. To-day Mr. Heath came and served out the
remainder of the clothes, that were left of the donation.
I received only a pair of shoes. This is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>the last that we may expect from the donation, either
in provisions or clothes, though we are allowed
oatmeal to thicken our broth, and coals to burn;
which are given, as I suppose, by private gentlemen.</p>

<p class='c000'>24. It is two years to-day since we were taken.
To-day a paper was drawn up in prison, to discover
who and how many were of a side, and to hasten
those who have a desire to petition, and to prevent
petitioning hereafter; for we have reason to think
it has already been of great damage to us. The
contents of the paper were as follows:</p>

<p class='c000'>“We, whose names are hereunto subscribed,
do, of our own free and voluntary consent, agree
firmly with each other, and hereby solemnly
swear, that we are fully determined to stand,
and so remain as long as we live, true and
loyal to our Congress, our country, our wives, children
and friends, and never to petition to enter
on board any of His Britannic Majesty’s ships or
vessels, or into any of his services whatsoever.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The above was signed by upwards of a hundred.
I was one of the number. Some of the number
that did not sign this, would not go on board of a
man-of-war any sooner than those that did sign
it.</p>

<p class='c000'>25. This is Christmas, and a sorrowful one it
is, though we had sent us, by our friends without,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>a fourpenny white loaf per mess, and a little cabbage.
Little did I think, last Christmas, of being
here now; neither did I expect, three months
ago, to be here to-day. But all signs seem to
fail; and it seems as though we were enchanted
here. A third year of our imprisonment has begun.</p>

<p class='c000'>26. We learn, by the papers, that Admiral Keppel
is to receive a trial by court martial, for his behavior
on the 27th of July last, in an engagement
with the French fleet, off Brest. He is confined
to his house, with two sentries at his door.</p>

<p class='c000'>27. Sunday. At this time, we have a hole in
hand, which we began near a month ago. This
hole is dug down by the side of the prison, about
nine feet perpendicular, and from thence it is dug
about fifteen feet under ground, across a road;
and our intention is to dig up into a garden on the
other side of the way. A great quantity of dirt has
already come out of this hole, and we have much
trouble in concealing it. We have filled every
hole and corner in the prison where we can with
safety hide it, and a great many large stones
are laid fore and aft the prison, in piles, under our
hammocks, with old garments laid over them.—There
has been so many holes discovered of late,
in this prison, that we are very cautious how we
proceed with this. We work only when the militia
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>are on guard, which is every other day, because
they are not so suspicious and exact in searching,
as the 13th regiment.</p>

<p class='c000'>28. We have now got the hole almost completed,
and mean to put our plan into execution
to-night, and I hope God will be with us. Never
did I know the true value of money until now; if
I had four or five guineas, I could scarcely have a
doubt of my liberty; but from the want of this I
expect to be brought back again if I should have
the good fortune to get out. While I now write,
we are dividing ourselves into companies, to cast
lots who shall go out first, so as to give every one
an equal chance that intends to go; except three
that dug the hole—they are to go first. I believe
that nearly one half in prison intend to go, if possible;
but I fear that but very few will get out
before we shall be discovered, on account of their
being four walls to get over, about eight feet high,
each, after we get into the garden, and before we
get into the road.</p>

<p class='c000'>29. Last night we opened the hole and shut it
up again, until about twelve o’clock. We then
opened it again, and a man went out and opened
a window in the first wall. We likewise chose
two of the principal men in prison, that did not intend
to go, to take the list of each company, and
stand one upon each side the hole, to see that every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>man went out in his turn. It fell to my lot to
go out in the first company, after those who dug
the hole. I went through, and came to the first
wall, where the window was open. Three more
walls I had to get over, which were so high that I
could just jump and catch the tops of them; all of
which, we went over like greyhounds. Then six
of us met and concluded to go together. We then
ran back into the country until we judged we were
two or three miles out of Plymouth, and in this
manner we rambled about the fields, up hill and
down dale, over hedges and through ditches, till
we were lost and could not find the right road to
Tinemouth, which was the town we meant to aim
for, about thirty-six miles from Plymouth. Before
we were lost, we walked about twenty miles, as
we judged, backwards and forwards, through the
fields. We then sat down by the side of a hill, till
we were almost chilled to death. We then proceeded
to a haystack, under the lee of which we lay
until the day began to break, and it being cloudy,
we could not discover the east from the west; so
we wandered about till daylight, when we found
the road to Tinemouth, and pressed forward till
we came to a bridge, where, by the help of a milestone,
we found, to our great surprise, that we
were only three miles from Plymouth. At this
bridge I pulled off a pair of trowsers, which I wore
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>to keep my breeches and stockings clean, and
threw them into the stream. We then pushed
on two miles farther, in the road. By this time,
the people began to stir about, and we concluded
it was no longer safe to walk by daylight. We
then took a cross road that led into the country,
and travelled about a mile, and then cut across
some fields, and went into a hedge, where we determined
to lay till night, and then proceed on our
journey. It was almost seven o’clock in the morning
when we went into the hedge, and we lay
there undiscovered, as we supposed, until an hour
before sunset. All this time, we lay on the
wet grass, and had nothing to eat or drink. We
had only a penny loaf apiece, and that we
meant to save to eat in the night following, and so
travel all night; the next morning we expected to
reach Tinemouth. About nine hours we lay in
the hedge, wet, hungry, and almost chilled to
death with the cold; lying all the time in one position,
longing for the night to come. I went to
stir one of my legs and a bone snapped and went
out of joint, and as one of the company was setting
it, about ten farmers, with a soldier, came upon us.
One of them had a pistol, one a bayonet, one a
flail, and all the rest had clubs; we told them
that we came into Plymouth in a prize, and
were bound to Tinemouth. The country was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>alarmed, and we were taken. They carried us to
a little village and gave us a good glass of brandy,
and a halfpenny cake, apiece. We were then
guarded by a sergeant of the militia, and about a
dozen farmers, to Plymouth. We stopped on the
road to get something to drink, but they would not
let us stop to eat. We came to Plymouth in the
evening, and some hundred men gathered round
us and caused great confusion and excited a tumultuous
broil. In this fray I lost my penny loaf.
From thence we were brought to prison again,
where we found that about thirty were taken
before us, and the Black-hole was full; so that we
were put in the long prison again. I was here informed
that one hundred and nine men got out at
this hole, and that it was carried on with the greatest
regularity, till a boy went out who was unable
to get over the wall, and he called for help, which
alarmed the guard; otherwise, every man in prison
might have got out, that had any inclination to do
so.</p>

<p class='c000'>30. Last night and to-day, about forty more were
brought back, and those in the Black-hole taken
out, and all put on half allowance.</p>

<p class='c000'>31. To-day a number more were brought back,
and those of us who are on short allowance, are
divided into messes, eight men in a mess, all to sit
down to a four pound loaf, and three pounds of
beef, before it is cooked, a bowl of broth, and a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>little cabbage, which we have only every other
day. To-day a mess of us joined together and
bought a bag of potatoes, of fifteen gallons, for two
shillings and ninepence, which will be of great service
to us, on our forty days’ half allowance.</p>

<p class='c000'>January 1, 1779. This is a new year, and a sorrowful
one it is, though our friends sent us a white
loaf to every mess on full allowance, and would
have sent one to those on half allowance, but our
cruel agent would not let it come in. This so
vexed us that we went and reasoned the case with
him, and he at last consented to let it come in, if
it was intended only as a new year’s gift. We
have also received greens, for four days past, instead
of cabbage or peas, which is not half so
good as either. We have to-day written a petition
to the Board to see if they will grant us peas, and
another, to see if they will favor us in regard
to provision or time, while on half allowance.
Two more men were brought back this
afternoon. As yet, I have not got over my frolic.
My knee is stiff where I put it out of joint. My
hands are sore, being torn with burs. In short, I
have not got a place about me the size of a
halfpenny, but what is stiff and sore.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. To-day we wrote a note to Mr. Heath, to let
him know that Mr. Coudry had consented to let a
loaf come in to each mess on half allowance, as a
new year’s gift. Also, to-day the agent served out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>shoes to almost every man in prison, except those
on half allowance. We have received a letter
from Portsmouth, which informs us that fifteen
men had gone from that prison on board the men-of-war,
last week, and that there are two hundred
and thirty American prisoners there.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. Sunday. In answer to the note we sent yesterday,
to Mr. Heath, we received a white loaf to
each mess on half allowance, and the generosity
of our friends led them to send us a sixpenny loaf,
which make our hearts glad.</p>

<p class='c000'>4. Notwithstanding there are so many of us on
half allowance, it does not discourage us from
digging, for yesterday we began another hole, and
last night it was unfortunately discovered.</p>

<p class='c000'>This afternoon another man was brought back,
who had got as far as Torbay, where he saw
three hundred sail of vessels, in three fleets,
one of which was bound to New York, one to
Halifax, and the other to the West Indies, most of
them with provisions, and some troops.</p>

<p class='c000'>5. Last night, Captain Boardman made his escape
from the officers’ prison, and as there has
been none brought back to-day, it gives us reason
to hope, that those who are now out, will escape
from this detested place. The number not yet returned
is twenty-four, as eighty-five out of one
hundred and nine have been brought back again.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>6. This morning, I began to set myself up to
sell bread, to enlarge the little amount of money I
have, while on half allowance. I send out to the
baker’s and purchase by the dozen, and retail it
out; by which means I realize twopence on a dozen.
As necessity is the mother of invention, so
necessity obliges me to take every honest method
to get a penny, especially at this time, when we
have greens, or cabbage as they are called, instead
of peas, but unworthy of the name of either, for it
is more like kelp than cabbage, and it is not fit for
any human being to eat.</p>

<p class='c000'>7. To-day a gentleman came to the gate and
gave in a crown, to be divided among ninety of
us in prison, who are on half allowance. This
crown gains a reprieve for a dog, which keeps in
the yard and belongs to some of the officers on
guard. This dog we are resolved to kill and eat,
in a few days, as necessity will oblige us to do so.
This evening two more men were brought back,
who went out on the 28th of December. They
were taken about forty miles distant, at a place
called Exmouth. There are now only twenty-two
out, as eighty-seven have been brought back. We
are told that five pounds a head is given for every
one that is taken up; if so, it has cost government
four hundred and thirty-five pounds for the eighty-seven
that are brought back.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>January</span> 8. It is two years, to-day, since we arrived
in this Sound. One of those that were
brought back yesterday, brought a paper in with
him, in which is an account of an hurricane that
happened about ten days ago, at London, in
which a great number of houses were blown down;
and by the same tornado, a great many vessels
were cast away, at Margate Roads, and a number
of lives lost. Among the rest was an East Indiaman.
By the paper, we also learn, that a great
part of Greenwich Hospital was consumed by a
fire that took place there.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>This is a much worse time to be on short allowance
than any time since we have been in prison.
As there are so many on half allowance, those who
are on full allowance, and are willing to help us,
are unable, for their own allowance is not sufficient
to support nature; and the half of that is intolerable.
There are numbers in prison on half allowance
who have not a penny to help themselves
with. New shoes have been sold for a shilling,
and new shirts for the same price, by persons who,
perhaps, had no others to wear; in short, there are
a great many long faces in prison, for nothing but
hunger rages throughout. To such a degree is
this the case, that we killed a dog this afternoon,
in order to let him cool by to-morrow, and his in-sides
were scarcely out, before his liver was on
coals broiling.</p>

<p class='c000'>9. This morning we divided the dog into quarters,
and he was dressed so neat, and being so fat
withall, that if I had seen him in a butcher’s shop
I should have thought it to be a young lamb, and
good meat. We had a bag of potatoes given us,
to eat with our venison. Some stewed theirs;
others roasted it; and I must confess, I made a tolerable
meal out of some of this roasted dog, with
potatoes dipped in its drippings. Rats have been
eat in this prison often before. To-day the agent
told us that he had received an answer to our petition,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>and that we are to be allowed peas instead
of greens, which is much better. He had received
an order, that if we would deliver up those who
were most active in digging the hole, the rest
should be restored to full allowance. But the majority
in prison were inclined to give them no satisfaction.
This afternoon, however, two young
men, of their own accord, went and delivered themselves
up, and were sent to the Black-hole, thinking
to live well, I suppose, while there, as doubtless
they will.</p>

<p class='c000'>10. To-day we were all restored to full allowance,
and received peas. We had, also, white
bread sent in by our friends. Thus, it is either a
feast or a famine with us. I have been only eleven
days on half allowance. To-day, about twelve
o’clock, Mr. Heath sent a man to inform us that
a cartel had arrived in Plymouth, for us. Soon
after, Mr. Sorrey came with a letter which he had
received from the committee in London, and read it
to us, which informed us that one of the committee
had waited on Lord Savage, the head lord of
the Admiralty, to know the truth concerning this
cartel, and he informed him that the Milford
transport was engaged for that purpose, as a flag
ship, and that we should be exchanged, one hundred
at a time, and the first draft is to be from
this prison, as we were committed first; so we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>shall embark and proceed to Nantz, where they will
take an equal number, and so go on till all the
American prisoners in England are exchanged, if
there be enough English prisoners in France that
were taken by the Americans. There were only
about forty or fifty committed before me, but as
there have been upwards of one hundred who have
lately attempted to escape from here, and most of
them brought back, myself among the number;
and as it is customary in time of war for such to
forfeit their turn, I began to despair of going in
the first draft. In the mean time, all hands were
called to hear a letter read, which the agent had
received from the Lords of the Admiralty, who desired
him to inform us that we were to be exchanged
for the English prisoners in France, taken
by the Americans; and that, notwithstanding
a number of us had attempted our escape, and by
this means had forfeited our turn, yet, in this
instance we should be forgiven upon condition
that we discovered through what corruption, or
negligence, we effected our escape. This being
read, he ordered the Black-hole doors to be
opened. This is joyful news to us. Joy is to be
seen on every man’s countenance. This is a
blessed day!</p>

<p class='c000'>11. This afternoon Mr. Heath came to congratulate
us on our prospect of deliverance, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>brought a letter with him, which informed us that
the cartel is now in Plymouth, waiting only for a
man to come from France to take charge of us.</p>

<p class='c000'>12. To-day Mr. Sorrey came, and brought every
man a sixpence, which is part of twenty pounds
that has lately been sent down from London, and
which was left of the old stock; but we hear that
they are about opening a new subscription.</p>

<p class='c000'>13. We learn, from the papers, that the Spaniards
have now seventy sail of the line, besides
frigates and sloops, in different parts of Spain,
mounting in all, seven thousand and three cannons,
of different bores.</p>

<p class='c000'>14. The sick, in the hospital, are most of them
on the recovering order now, except three that
moved down yesterday; and to-night I am to go
down and watch with them, as of late, since there
has been so many sick, we have been allowed, two
of a night, to go down and watch with them.</p>

<p class='c000'>15. This afternoon a pardon came down from
the King, for fifteen men in this prison, that petitioned
last to go on board the men-of-war; three
of the number are already on board. They went
out at the last hole, for that purpose. After the
officers came to receive them, out of the twelve
that remained in prison only four went, which
makes forty-nine, in all, that have gone on board
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>the men-of-war from this prison; besides numbers
who have broke out and gone. It is astonishing
to me, that men who have been used by the English
as we have been, with all the severity that
they have been masters of, should afterwards voluntarily
enter their service.</p>

<p class='c000'>16. Nothing remarkable.</p>

<p class='c000'>17. Sunday. Nothing remarkable.</p>

<p class='c000'>18. This forenoon, some officers from the ships
came for some Frenchmen in the other yard, to
carry them on board the men-of-war, and five out
of the eight who would not go last Friday, altered
their minds, and went, which makes fifty-four that
have gone out of this yard, on board the men-of-war.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are exactly two hundred and fifty American
prisoners left here. This being the Queen’s
birth-day, the garrison and fort, and each ship in
the harbor, in commission, fired twenty-one guns,
as a royal salute.</p>

<p class='c000'>19. We wait very impatiently for the man which
we hear is to come from France to take charge of
us. Though I am sensible he will make no unnecessary
delays, yet he seems a long time coming;
so long, that some in prison begin to be doubtful
whether he will come at all.</p>

<p class='c000'>20. Some in prison, so far despair of a cartel,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>that they have begun another hole. There was
brought again, to-day, sixpence apiece for each
man in prison.</p>

<p class='c000'>21. Last night eleven Frenchmen made their
escape from a separate prison, in another yard,
and five soldiers are confined on the same account.</p>

<p class='c000'>22. This forenoon Mr. Sorrey came again, and
brought a couple of letters which he received from
Bilboa, one of which was from Mr. Emery, of Bilboa,
to Captain Lee’s crew, which informed them
that Captain Lee had arrived in Bilboa, and that
his whole crew, if they would write, might be supplied
with fifty shillings a share, and Captain Bradbury,
in this prison, with six guineas.</p>

<p class='c000'>This afternoon, all hands were called, and the
agent called over the names of the hundred that
were to go in the first draft, and desired that we
should hold ourselves in readiness to be exchanged.
Never was I so rejoiced to hear my
name called, upon any occasion, as upon this. I
am about the fortieth upon the agent’s list. It appears
that we are not to be exchanged as we were
captured, but according to the date of our commitment,
so that all our crew will not be included
in the first draft. Out of one hundred and twenty
which arrived in England, belonging to the Dolton,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>only eighty-six are left in prison to be exchanged.</p>

<p class='c000'>23. We are so well assured of a cartel, now,
that we lay aside all schemes for effecting our escape,
and look out daily for orders to embark. An
officer that belonged to the Mermaid frigate, that
was chased ashore in America, who has been a
prisoner in Philadelphia about a month, and has
since been exchanged, and now arrived home,
came to see us this afternoon, and talked with us.
He gave us a very sad account of the price of provisions
in America.</p>

<p class='c000'>24. It is twenty-five months this night, that I
have been a prisoner. We have been informed
that last night, some men were discovered, in attempting
to set fire to the King’s dock-yard, in this
port.</p>

<p class='c000'>25. There are seven or eight now in the hospital,
sick with fevers, but most of them are upon the
recovering order, except those who were lately
taken sick, two of which number labor under
great concern of mind, relating to their future
state, and to-day we obtained liberty of Mr. Coudry,
to send for a minister.</p>

<p class='c000'>26. It is two years and two months, to-day,
since I sailed from Portsmouth, in the brig Dolton.</p>

<p class='c000'>27. Nothing remarkable.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>28. As to-morrow is port day, we put great dependence
on it, expecting an order from London
concerning our exchange.</p>

<p class='c000'>29. This morning Mr. Sorrey brought each of
us another sixpence, which balances the twenty
pounds before mentioned; and two of our officers,
as usual, went up into the agent’s office, to receive
the money. The agent showed them a letter which
he had received from London, with a pardon from
the King for the first hundred that is to be exchanged.</p>

<p class='c000'>30. Nothing remarkable.</p>

<p class='c000'>31. Sunday. This is port day again, and there
is no news for us to-day. It was a week last Friday
since we were told to hold ourselves in readiness
to be exchanged, and no signs of a cartel appears.
If Job himself was here, his patience would
be worn out.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>February</span> 1. This morning about three o’clock,
Mr. John Foster died in the prison hospital, of a
nervous fever. Some of Mr. Foster’s townsmen
were of a mind that he should be buried in a white
linen shirt, but they received for an answer, that
no person in this country was allowed to be buried
in any thing but sheep’s clothing. The American
prisoners, who died in the royal hospitals, were
buried in black, but very rough coffins; but those
who die in prison are buried in a rough white
coffin. This Mr. Foster is the eighth man that has
died since I came to prison—the seventh man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>of our crew that has died since we have been
taken, and the seventeenth American prisoner that
has died in prison and in the royal hospital, since
we were captured.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. To-day a gentleman came here, whom we are
informed is but fourteen days from Dunkirk, but
last from London, and he brought a letter from
the Board, which ordered the agent to let him inspect
every thing which he had a mind to. He
looked at our meat, weighed our bread, and tasted
our beef, and we are told that he has been in every
prison in France.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. This morning about five o’clock, Elias Vickery
died. He was a Marblehead man. He was
taken in one of the Freedom’s prizes; and about
six o’clock, Asa Witham died. He belongs to
New Gloucester, and was taken in the Dolton. They
have both been sick upwards of twelve months.—They
make ten in number that have died since I
have been in prison, and eight of our crew since
we have been taken, and nineteen in all that have
died of different crews since we have been taken.
Last evening Mr. Deal made his escape from the
officers’ prison.</p>

<p class='c000'>4. Three men have died this week, and there
are sixteen or eighteen now sick. Of late, every
day more or less are taken sick, and most of them
with fever. Yesterday a French frigate, of twenty-six
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>guns, was brought in here, which was taken
by an English frigate.</p>

<p class='c000'>5. This is another port day, and no news for us,
concerning a cartel. It is unaccountable to me
that it is so long coming. It is twenty months
to-day, since I entered this prison.</p>

<p class='c000'>6. It is so long since we heard of a cartel that
the greater part in prison begin to despair of its
coming. Many of those in prison are like so
many children; as long as a rattle is ringing in
their ears, they are quiet and easy, but as soon as
the rattle stops, they are faithless and impatient.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have another hole in hand, which will
take us nearly a month to complete; so that if this
news proves abortive, we may have recourse to another
way.</p>

<p class='c000'>Last evening a man made his escape over the
wall, but before any one could get out, it was discovered.</p>

<p class='c000'>7. This is another port day, and no news for
us.</p>

<p class='c000'>8. Nothing remarkable.</p>

<p class='c000'>9. This afternoon Mr. Sorrey sent us sixpence
apiece to each man in prison, which we are
informed, is part of a new subscription which is
opened.</p>

<p class='c000'>10. Yesterday was port day, and this morning
the agent informed us that His Majesty had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>graciously pleased to pardon one hundred of us, in
order for an exchange; and that he had received
an order from the Board of Commissioners of sick
and wounded seamen, to deliver one hundred of
us to Lieutenant Knox, whenever he should call
for us. This Lieutenant Knox is to command the
Milford transport, which is the cartel.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>11. We have been informed that the cartel is
in Portsmouth, and never heard to the contrary,
until to-day, when the agent informed us that she
is in Dartmouth, waiting only for a fair wind to
come down the channel.</p>

<p class='c000'>12. Nothing remarkable.</p>

<p class='c000'>13. Nothing transpired worthy of notice.</p>

<p class='c000'>14. Through some dirt that was laid about
the prison, and discovered by the turnkeys, which
gave them cause to suspect we had another hole
in hand, the guard came in, and after a long
search, found it.</p>

<p class='c000'>15. It is two years and three months since I sailed
in the brig Dolton, from Newbury.</p>

<p class='c000'>16. Nothing remarkable.</p>

<p class='c000'>17. Last night two men made their escape from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>the officers prison, but were taken up and brought
back to-day. Last night, Plymouth was illuminated
on account of Admiral Keppel being acquitted
with honor.</p>

<p class='c000'>18. The wind is to the eastward to-day, but no
signs of a cartel appears.</p>

<p class='c000'>19. Upon a large hill, a little distance from
the prison, we see a couple of flag-staffs erected,
but we know not the occasion of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>20. Upon the same hill where the flag-staffs were
erected yesterday, there were two large bonfires
last night, and the houses all around illuminated,
which, we are told, was on account of the plot
being discovered against the King’s dock-yard,
and last night was the time it was to be put into
execution.</p>

<p class='c000'>21. Nothing remarkable.</p>

<p class='c000'>24. Last night a man made his escape out of
this prison, by getting over the wall. This morning
Mr. Sorrey came, and brought each of us another
sixpence. For a few days past, we have had
no coals to burn. Mr. Sorrey informed us that a
bushel of coal is not to be purchased in Plymouth,
at any price. He also informed us that fourteen
sail of vessels, laden with coal, had lately been
taken, bound from Newcastle. This afternoon,
also, Mr. Heath came to see us; he has lately returned
from London. He read a letter to us,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>which informed us that the cartel is in the Downs,
detained only by contrary winds; also, that there
has been a great talk in London, concerning our
eating a dog, and that it had been published in the
papers, and he desired that we would let him know
the truth of it, whether we eat it from actual necessity
or not. Mr. Heath sent us some soap and
tobacco.</p>

<p class='c000'>25. This forenoon, a gentleman came to see us,
who is lately from London. He told us that when
he sailed, the cartel absolutely lay in the Downs.
By this time I hope we have got the truth of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>26. Yesterday three gentlemen, who are our
friends, came with Mr. Heath to see us. We
have been so long confined, that when a friend
comes into the yard to see us, we flock around
him like children, and love the ground he treads
upon. Also, to-day, we wrote them out the facts
relating to the dog, agreeably to their request.</p>

<p class='c000'>27. Nothing of interest.</p>

<p class='c000'>28. Sunday. The wind hauls round to the
northward and eastward, which gives us now to
hope that our cartel will be here in a few days.</p>

<p class='c000'>March 1. Nothing remarkable.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. Nothing worthy of notice.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. We understand that there is a fleet bound to
the East Indies, and another to the West Indies,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>that lay wind-bound, up channel, as well as our
cartel.</p>

<p class='c000'>4. This morning, James Valentine died with a
fever. He was a Marblehead man, and belonged
to Captain Lee’s crew. He is the twentieth man
that has died since I have been taken, and the
eleventh since I have been in prison. This has
been a fast day with us; for the beef that came in
this morning was so bad, and so far from being according
to contract, that we sent it back again.—The
second that came, was worse than the first,
and we refused it, also. Our peas are also bad, so
that we could not eat them, and by applying to the
officer of the guard, who spoke in our behalf, we
received cheese instead of beef, but not until evening.</p>

<p class='c000'>5. This morning we received the joyful tidings
that our cartel had arrived. Some of the Marblehead
men received letters from home, by way of
a vessel that was taken. The bills of exchange
for one hundred and nine pounds sterling, have
arrived from Bilboa, for Captain Lee’s crew, and
are sent to London to be answered.</p>

<p class='c000'>6. Notwithstanding our cartel has arrived, we
understand that she is to wait for orders from London,
before she can embark us.</p>

<p class='c000'>7. Nothing remarkable.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>8. This forenoon the outward bound East India
fleet, with their convoys, passed by this port.</p>

<p class='c000'>9. Nothing of interest.</p>

<p class='c000'>10. This morning Lieutenant Knox, who is to
transact the business of our exchange, came to see
us, and informed us that he expects to embark us
the beginning of next week. The cartel has come
up to Stonehouse creek, where we can see her
from the prison.</p>

<p class='c000'>11. Nothing remarkable.</p>

<p class='c000'>12. The wind has now veered round to the
southward, and blows up rain, which I fear will delay
our going.</p>

<p class='c000'>13. This afternoon the agent, Mr. Coudry, informed
us that on Monday, at ten o’clock, we
are to embark.</p>

<p class='c000'>14. Sunday. We are so impatient to be gone,
that every moment of this day seems an hour
long.</p>

<p class='c000'>15. It is two years and four months to-day, since
I left Newbury. This forenoon, about eleven
o’clock, ninety-seven of us in number, were guarded
down, and embarked on board the cartel—two
of our number having died since we received
the King’s pardon, and one being dangerously ill.</p>

<p class='c000'>16. We are now on board the cartel, and waiting
only for a fair wind to sail. We are allowed
the liberty of the deck, by day and night, and we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>have tolerable good accommodations. We lodge
in cabins; most of us have beds of our own, and
those who have not, have King’s bedding. There
are three or four sick amongst us, and they have
single cabins by themselves. To-day we had salt
beef and pudding, which is a great rarity.</p>

<p class='c000'>17. The wind is still against us, but I feel much
easier here than I should be in prison. Here we have
a change of diet, though it is no more than prisoners’
allowance, and both officers and men behave
very civil to us.</p>

<p class='c000'>18. To-day Mr. Heath came on board, and another
of our friends, and brought some wine, tea,
and sugar, and other necessaries, for those who
are sick.</p>

<p class='c000'>19. To-day the prison doctor came on board,
and informed us that Bonner Darling is dead—a
negro man that belonged to Marblehead, and one
of our crew. He makes twenty-one that have died
since I have been taken; and nine of the number
were of the Dolton’s company.</p>

of this month; have our board paid, and have
nothing to do but walk about town. I have tried,
but can get no labor, as business is very much
stagnated here. Nearly forty sail of merchantmen
are hauled up, and lay idle in this port.</p>

<p class='c000'>14. About forty of our men have entered with
Captain Jones, for twelve months, and this morning
they set out for L’Orient, about seventy-five
miles distant, by land.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>17. Yesterday and to-day, I have been at work

Alliance arrived here, with prisoners to be exchanged
for us.</p>

<p class='c000'>28. This day I received from Mr. Odaire, sixteen

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>June 20. Last night, precisely at 12 o’clock,
just as the starboard watch was going on deck, it
was very pleasant weather, and we were lying to,
with our topsails back to the masts. Captain Jones
came down before the wind and run us down upon
our starboard quarter, carrying away our mizen-mast,
and doing us much damage, and himself
more, by springing his bowsprit, carrying away his
head and cut-water, but fortunately no one was
killed on board either of the ships.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>July 2. We arrived at L’Orient, after a cruize
of thirteen days; likewise, the prize brig, which
we took on the 28th of June, from Bordeaux bound
to Dublin, with five hundred and sixty casks of
wine and brandy on board.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c018'><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>August 14. Having repaired our ships, and got
a clean bottom, we sailed this day for L’Orient
on a cruise with Captain Jones, two French frigates,
two brigs, and a cutter. With this fleet we
made the best of our way to Ireland. On our passage,
we took in company a ship; soon after, Captain
Jones took a brig laden with provisions. A
few days after, we made Ireland. Upon making
land, Captain Jones took a brig from Newfoundland,
laden with oil and blubber, and after cruizing
a few days along shore, we parted from the
fleet in a gale of wind.</p>

<p class='c021'>Whether I was, or was not deceived, will best appear
by a relation of circumstances.</p>

<p class='c021'>The little squadron under my orders, consisting of the
Bon homme Richard, of 40 guns, the Alliance, of 36
guns, the Pallas, of 32 guns, the Cerf, of 18 guns, and
the Vengeance, of 12 guns, joined by two privateers,
the Monsieur and the Granville, sailed from the Road
of Groaix at day-break on the 14th of August.</p>

<p class='c021'>The evening of the 26th brought with it stormy weather,
with the appearance of a severe gale from the S. W.
The gale continued to increase in the night, with thick
weather. To prevent separation, I carried a top-light,
and fired a gun every quarter of an hour. I carried, also,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>very moderate sail, and the course had already been
clearly pointed out before night, yet with all this precaution,
I found myself accompanied only by the brigantine
Vengeance in the morning, the Granville having remained
astern with a prize. As I have since understood,
the tiller of the Pallas broke, after midnight,
which disabled her from keeping up, but no apology
has yet been made on behalf of the Alliance.</p>

<p class='c021'>On the 31st, we saw the Flamie Islands situated near
the Lewis, on the N. W. coast of Scotland; and the
next morning, off Cape Wrath, we gave chase to a ship
to windward; at the same time two ships appeared in the
N. W. quarter which proved to be the Alliance and
a prize ship which she had taken, bound, as I understand,
from Liverpool to Jamaica. The ship which I chased
brought too at noon; she proved to be the Union letter
of marque, bound from London to Quebec, with a cargo
of naval stores on account of government, adapted
for the service of the British armed vessels on the lakes.
The public despatches were lost, as the Alliance very
imprudently hoisted American colors, though English
colors were then flying on board the Bon homme Richard.
Captain Landais sent a small boat to ask whether
I would man the ship or he should, as in the latter case
he would suffer no boat nor person from the Bon homme
Richard to go near the prize. Ridiculous as this appeared
to me, I yielded to it for the sake of peace, and
received the prisoners on board the Bon homme Richard,
while the prize was manned from the Alliance.</p>

<p class='c021'>On the morning of the 4th, the Alliance appeared
again, and had brought too two very small coasting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>sloops, in ballast, but without having attended properly
to my orders of yesterday. The Vengeance joined me
soon after, and informed me that in consequence of
Captain Landais’ orders to the commanders of the two
prize ships, they had refused to follow him to the rendezvous.
I am at this moment ignorant of what orders
these men received from Captain Landais, nor know I
by virtue of what authority he ventured to give his orders
to prizes in my presence, and without either my
orders or approbation.</p>

<hr class='c023' />

<p class='c000'>Two rich Letters of Marque were taken off the coast
of Scotland, and Captain Landais took upon himself,
even under my very nose, and without my knowledge,
to order them to Bergen, in Norway, where they were
given up to the English.—<cite>Paul Jones to the Board of
Admiralty.</cite></p>

<hr class='c023' />

<p class='c000'>Three of their prizes sent into Bergen, in Norway,
were, at the instance of the British minister, seized by
order of the court of Denmark, and delivered up to him.—<cite>Letter
from Dr. Franklin to Samuel Huntington, Esq.
President of Congress.</cite></p>

<hr class='c023' />

<p class='c000'>The following letter from Dr. Franklin to Paul Jones,
shows the value of those prizes, taken and delivered up
as above. There can be no doubt that Mr. Herbert
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>was sent in one of the above prizes, as the next entry
in his journal is from Bergen, in Norway.</p>

<div class='c024'><em>Havre, July 21st, 1785.</em></div>

<p class='c021'><em>The Hon. Paul Jones.</em></p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Dear Sir</span>,—The offer of which you desire I would
give you the particulars, was made to me by M. le
Baron de Waltersdorff, in behalf of His Majesty the
King of Denmark, by whose ministers he said he was
authorised to make it. It was to give the sum of ten
thousand pounds sterling, as a compensation for having
delivered up the prizes to the English. I did not accept
it, conceiving it much too small a sum, they having
been valued to me at sixty thousand pounds. I wrote
to Mr. Hodgson, an insurer in London, requesting he
would procure information of the sums insured on those
Canada ships. His answer was, that he could find no
traces of such insurance, and he believed none was
made, for the government, on whose account they were
said to be loaded with military stores, never insured.—But,
by the best judgment he could make, he thought
they might be worth about sixteen or eighteen thousand
pounds each.</p>

<hr class='c023' />

<p class='c000'>By the following letter it will be seen that Bergen
was one of the places designated by Dr. Franklin, for
sending prizes to.</p>

<div class='c024'><em>Passy, June 30th, 1779.</em></div>

<p class='c021'><em>Hon. Captain Jones.</em></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Dear Sir</span>,—The prizes you may make, send to
Dunkirk, Ostend, or Bergen, in Norway, according to
your proximity to either of those ports.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>February 5th, 1780. This day our officers received
a letter from France, from a gentleman in
Paris, which informs us that the King of Denmark
is to pay for the prizes we brought in here, fifty
thousand pounds Stirling, which is two hundred
and fifty thousand Rix dollars. He is likewise to
pay all our expenses while here. We likewise received
orders to repair to Dunkirk as quick as
possible, but we are to have a pass from the King
of Denmark, which is what we wait for.</p>

<p class='c000'>8. This day I received a pair of shoes, in
balance of four shillings due me as wages.</p>

<p class='c000'>25. This day I received half a guinea of a
Scotchman, for which I gave him eleven shillings.</p>

<p class='c000'>March 4. This morning arrived here from Virginia,
a ship laden with tobacco, under French
colors.</p>

<p class='c000'>18. Fortunately I have got another guinea for
which I paid only twenty-one shillings.</p>

<p class='c000'>21. This day I received a pair of shoes, at five
shillings.</p>

<p class='c000'>April 1. I have received one shilling and sixpence
for repairing shoes.</p>

<p class='c000'>5. This day I received of Captain Thomas
White, in behalf of wages due, four Rix dollars,
each valued at four shillings stirling.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have worked several days on board the before-mentioned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>tobacco ship, and have likewise made
some chests for the seamen, for all of which I received
four dollars.</p>

<p class='c000'>10. This day I received of Captain Thomas
White, two pounds six shillings and sevenpence
halfpenny, stirling, which was the ballance due me
for clothing which I was charged with, but did not
receive—all of which was given by the King of
Denmark. The occasion of this was, that when
we were turned on shore, many of our men were
in want of clothing. Our officers interceded for
them, and procured the amount of four pounds
four shillings sterling each; and as I received only
a trifle in clothing, I received the remainder in
money.</p>

<p class='c000'>11. This day we embarked on board a gallion,
of about seventy tons, found and provisioned by
the King of Denmark, to carry us to Dunkirk,
after boarding us here nearly six months.</p>

<p class='c000'>19. This day we sailed from Bergen, after being
there seven months and five days.</p>

<p class='c000'>May 4. We arrived at Dunkirk, after a passage
of seventeen days.</p>

<p class='c000'>5. To-day I received of Captain Thomas
White, forty livres, in behalf of wages due.</p>

<p class='c000'>16. We set out to travel to Paris, which is
one hundred and eighty miles, having a wagon
to carry our baggage, and received eighteen livres
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>per man, of Mr. Coffin, the American agent in
Flanders, to bear our expenses to Paris.</p>

<p class='c000'>21. This day, about eight o’clock in the morning,
we arrived in the city of Paris, after a pleasant
journey of more than three days, through Flanders
into France and Paris. After we arrived at
Paris we put up our horses, and stopped not either
to eat or to drink, but made the best of our way to
Passy, about four miles from Paris, where Dr.
Franklin resides. After we came to Dr. Franklin’s
house and had a little conversation with him,
he ordered his servants to get us breakfast, which
we eat in his house, and likewise dinner. The
Dr. sent his servants to provide lodgings for us,
which he could not procure, on account of the
King and Queen, and all the nobility, being in
town, and all the public houses being taken up;
therefore we carried our luggage to Dr. Franklin’s
house, where we were well entertained; and
here we saw Mr. Adams and Mr. Dean. We procured
lodgings for ourselves in the afternoon. The
gentleman who owns the house where Dr. Franklin
resides, ordered one of his servants to show us
his gardens, to guide us through the town, and
show us the King and Queen and all the nobility;
these we have seen twice to-day, as they passed
through the town, besides many other curious objects,
both in Paris and Passy.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>23. To-day our board was paid, and we
received two guineas to bear our expenses to
L’Orient, which is three hundred and sixty miles,
and likewise a pass.[E] We shall be obliged to travel
on foot; therefore I am compelled to sell, or give
away, all my clothing, except a trifle of the best,
which I shall retain as a change.</p>

<p class='c000'>[Footnote E: The widow of Mr. Herbert has now in her possession
a crown piece, which her husband received of Dr.
Franklin, at this time.]</p>

<p class='c000'>24. This day we commenced our journey to
L’Orient.</p>

<p class='c000'>June 5. We arrived at L’Orient.</p>

<p class='c000'>7. To-day I went on board the Alliance.</p>

<p class='c000'>8. We sailed in the Alliance for America, in
company with a ship, a brig, a schooner and a
lugger. Also, I received this day of the purser,
on board the Alliance, two shirts, one pair of
shoes, a pair of trousers and a knife.</p>

<p class='c000'>July 10. This day I received of the purser, one
outside jacket.</p>

<p class='c000'>August 13. We made land, which proved to
be Cape Ann, having a passage of thirty-eight
days, from land to land.</p>

<p class='c000'>I left the Alliance, August 21st, and arrived
home at Newbury, August 23d, 1780.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Marquis de Lafayette, who arrived here on the
11th of February, brought me yours of October 28th,
and the new commission, credentials, and instructions,
the Congress have honored me with.
I immediately acquainted the minister of foreign affairs
with my appointment, and communicated to him, as
is usual, a copy of my credential letter, on which a day
was named for my reception. The end of that part of
the instructions, which relates to American seamen taken
by the French in English ships, had already been
obtained; Captain Jones having had for some time, an
order from court, directed to the keepers of the prisoners,
requiring them to deliver to him such Americans as
should be found in their hands, that they might be at liberty
to serve under his command. Most of them, if
not all, have been delivered to him. The minister of
marine requesting that the Alliance might be added to
Commodore Jones’ little squadron, and offering to give
Mr. Adams a passage in the frigate, with the new ambassador,
I thought it best to continue her a little longer
in Europe, hoping she may, in the projected cruize, by
her extraordinary swiftness, be a means of taking prisoners
enough to redeem the rest of our countrymen now
in the English jails. With this view, I ordered her
to join Captain Jones, at L’Orient, and obey his orders,
where she is now, accordingly.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Honored and Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p class='c021'>On the 19th ult., the American squadron under my
command, consisting of the Bon homme Richard, 42
guns, Alliance, 36 guns, Pallas, 30 guns, Cerf, 18 guns,
and the Vengeance, 12 guns, sailed from hence with a
convoy of merchant ships and transports with troops,
&amp;c., bound to the different ports and garrisons between
this place and Bordeaux.</p>

<p class='c021'>On the evening of the following day, I had the satisfaction
to see the latter part of the convoy safe within
the entrance of the river of Bordeaux, the rest having
been safely escorted into the entrance of Nantz, Rochefort,
&amp;c. But at the preceding midnight, while lying-to
off Isle of Vew, the Bon homme Richard and Alliance
got foul of one another, and carried away the head and
cut-water, sprit-sail yard, and jib-boom of the former,
with the mizen-mast of the latter; fortunately, however,
neither received damage in the hull. In the evening
of the 21st, I sent the Cerf to reconnoitre two sail, and
Captain Varage was so ardent in the pursuit, that he
had lost sight of the squadron next morning; and I am
now told, that he had a warm engagement with one of
them, a sloop of 14 guns, which he took, but was obliged
to abandon, on the approach of another enemy of superior
force. The action lasted an hour and a half; several
men were killed and wounded on board the Cerf.
That cutter is now fitting at L’Orient. On the 22d we
had a rencontre with three ships of war. They were to
windward, and bore down in a line abreast for some time,
but seeing we were prepared to receive them, they
hauled their wind, and by carrying a press of sail got
clear, in spite of our utmost endeavors to bring them to
action. On the 26th, we lost company of the Alliance
and Pallas. I am unable to say where the blame lays.
I gave the ships a rendezvous off Penmark rocks, but did
not meet them there.</p>

<p class='c021'>I anchored here yesterday noon, having had a rencontre
the night before with two of the enemy’s ships
of war in the offing, in the sight of this island and Belle
Isle. Previous to this I had given the Vengeance leave
to make the best of her way to this road, so that the enemy
found me alone in a place where I had no expectation
of a hostile visit. They appeared at first earnest to
engage, but their courage failed, and they fled with precipitation,
and to my mortification out-sailed the Bon
homme Richard and got clear. I had, however, a flattering
proof of the martial spirit of my crew, and I am
confident, that had I been able to get between the two,
which was my intention, we should have beaten them
both together.</p>

<p class='c000'>I can say nothing about Captain Landais’ prize. I
suppose the minister has an account of it, but I have
heard nothing from him about it. If he reclaims it on
account of his passport, we must then consider what is
to be done. I approve of the careenage proposed for
the Alliance, as a thing necessary. As she is said to
be a remarkable swift sailer, I should hope you might
by her means take some privateers and a number of
prisoners, so as to continue the cartel, and redeem all
our poor countrymen.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.</p>

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE<br />
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p>The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
